In such conditions, exercising LGs' competences becomes a real challenge.

Local governments (LGs) throughout the region faced numerous challenges in meeting the emergency needs and protecting community health and wellbeing during the pandemic. What started as a health crisis turned into the biggest economic recession since the World War II, with severe and long-lasting consequences.    </p>\r\n<p>SEE local governments have been and will certainly remain at the forefront in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic social and economic crisis. Their challenges need to be listened to and understood, and they must be supported to address these challenges in the most effective and efficient manner.</p>\r\n<p>Efforts must now focus on measures aimed at managing the social, economic and financial dimension of this crisis. The types, the consistency and the timing of the recovery measures will play a crucial role in the actual social and economic recovery. Clearly, local governments have a key role in successfully designing and implementing such recovery strategies as they are best positioned to better and more quickly understanding the local community needs.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the Survey reports:</strong></p>\r\n<p title=\"Summary: NALAS COVID-19 Survey\"><a href=\"/Home/Download/Survey_Summary\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> Summary: NALAS COVID-19 Survey</a></p>\r\n<p title=\"NALAS Survey SEE Local Governments in Post COVID-19 Socio-Economic Recovery\"><a href=\"/Home/Download/Covid_19_Survey\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> NALAS Survey SEE Local Governments in Post COVID-19 Socio-Economic Recovery</a></p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SUrvey_pic1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png"], "file_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/Survey_Summary", "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/Covid_19_Survey"], "files": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/Survey_Summary", "path": "Survey_Summary", "checksum": "5c44f1dd86cd33106bde3f58ba3f6bd0", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Home/Download/Survey_Summary"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/Covid_19_Survey", "path": "Covid_19_Survey", "checksum": "59696edef4bb9bd546f17317706b9da1", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Home/Download/Covid_19_Survey"}], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SUrvey_pic1.png", "path": "low-SUrvey_pic1.png", "checksum": "ce46dbae28df07b82e70e3e63f311973", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SUrvey_pic1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg", "path": "low-social1.jpg", "checksum": "dd9c28f4af95cf1006a3f7700a1b7b84", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png", "path": "low-genderswm.png", "checksum": "32c9f8a96541ab54b98fe8f73de06b5c", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png", "path": "low-grbbp.png", "checksum": "3894ebfb0ad4585eecb6b8c2adc81ab1", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png"}]},,

Looking to find out more about the quantity of waste generated and where it ends? NALAS' latest, 2019 report \"Benchmarking on Solid Waste Management in South-East Europe\" might have the answers.</p>\r\n<p>The report is a joint effort of the NALAS Task Force on Solid Waste and Water Management. It provides a comparative picture of the state of waste management sector both at the national and local level in countries of South-East Europe. Secondly, as the third in a series of benchmarking reports this document aims to follow the trends in waste management practice in countries of the region and monitor progress towards meeting EU standards in this field. Furthermore, the Report can provide LGAs material and arguments for policymaking but also ideas and inputs for future development projects or programs.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, this document has an awareness-raising purpose in terms of promoting and communicating new trends and policies in waste management and related topics introduced by the EU. In this particular case the topic of Circular Economy was introduced by extending the methodological approach with two additional indicators, one local and one national, and the survey about the basic concept and Circular Economy principles among NALAS SWWM Task Force members.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Download the report:</p>\r\n<p title=\"Benchmarking Report on Solid Waste Management in South-East

The Best Practices were gathered through a questionnaire, designed to collect information about the implementation of past GRB practices at local level.</p>\r\n<p>The objective is for this Compendium to serve as a learning tool for local level officials and GRB practitioners. For this purpose, the GRB best-practices gathered and documented in this publication will be stored in the NALAS knowledge tree, GRB best practice database. In addition, the collection of case studies is published on NALAS website and is offered as a resource through the E-Academy and its GRB e-learning course2 . The desired outcome is for local officials and GRB practitioners to learn and possibly replicate these proven approaches or get inspired for innovating new ones.</p>\r\n<p>The Compendium encompasses 17 best practices from 9 economies of the region: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Republic of Moldova, Turkey, Slovenia and Serbia. The practices are related to the following areas: gender participation, women’s economic empowerment, gender-based violence, sports, balancing work and life, and urban planning. The Best Practices are collected by NALAS gender associates and in cooperation with NALAS member associations of local authorities in the course of 2021. The publication also presents GRB champions – local practitioners, individuals who either work in the municipality or in municipal body/enterprise, or are representative of Civil Society Organizations (CSO) that contributed to the implementation of the Best Practice. The methodology for collection of good practices and editing of information on good practices was provided by Ms. Marija Risteska, NALAS Regional Gender Expert.</p>\r\n<p>This publication is part of NALAS project “Promoting e-learning and regional knowledge base development on gender-responsive budgeting”, supported in the framework of UN Women project “Promoting Gender Responsive Polices and Budgets: Towards Transparent, Inclusive and Accountable Governance in the Republic of North Macedonia”, financed by Switzerland and Sweden.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p title=\"Compendium of Gender Responsive Budgeting Best Practices\"><a href=\"/Home/Download/GRB_Comp\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> Compendium of Gender Responsive Budgeting Best Practices</a></p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-2021FR.png"], "file_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/GRB_Comp"], "files": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/GRB_Comp", "path": "GRB_Comp", "checksum": "ba2473799f79ba37d8dfbce70eee05ba", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Home/Download/GRB_Comp"}], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png", "path": "low-grbbp.png", "checksum": "3894ebfb0ad4585eecb6b8c2adc81ab1", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg", "path": "low-social1.jpg", "checksum": "dd9c28f4af95cf1006a3f7700a1b7b84", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png", "path": "low-genderswm.png", "checksum": "32c9f8a96541ab54b98fe8f73de06b5c", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-2021FR.png", "path": "low-2021FR.png", "checksum": "2e30c5477f8f5d47738564ef637b10e4", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-2021FR.png"}]},,

The South-East Europe region faces vast socio-economic challenges, while the economic consolidation is slow and only reaches part of the population. Those suffering the consequences are primarily the vulnerable groups, such as persons with disabilities, economically disadvantaged people, residents of rural areas, single parents, elderly, young people, ethnic minorities as well as women and girls. Traditional roles, prejudices against ethnic minorities, and exclusion of people with disabilities are anchored deep in the society and influence the political discourse.</p>\r\n<p>Many citizens belonging to the vulnerable groups lack knowledge about their social rights and access to social services, education, and healthcare. On the other hand, municipalities and other relevant stakeholders that need to bridge this gap often face the lack of knowledge and competencies, as well as insufficient financial resources. In addition, the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its 17 development goals, and especially the “Leave No One Behind” principle, enjoys little attention among the authorities and is progressing slowly.</p>\r\n<p>In the frame of NALAS’ project “Enhancing local capacities to implement the 2030 Agenda and the “Leave No One Behind” Principle”, 12 municipalities went a step further, learned and implemented different social inclusion approaches that ensured inclusion of the most vulnerable ones.</p>\r\n<p>This booklet presents these 12 good practices on provision of social services to the left behind communities piloted by local governments throughout the region. The practices were developed in the frame of the regional peer-to-peer exchange learning clusters on social inclusion approaches, managed by NALAS’ member associations <a href=\"http://www.nalas.eu/News/Inclusive_approaches#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\"></a>from the target economies, supported by resource persons.</p>\r\n<p>The practices are presented in five chapters related to the five social inclusion approaches:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Day-care centre;</li>\r\n<li>Minority inclusion models (social dialogue forum and minority commissioner);</li>\r\n<li>Mobile outreach teams;</li>\r\n<li>Raising the awareness on the rights of the vulnerable groups; and</li>\r\n<li>Inclusive disaster risk management.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>All of the 12 practices are inspirational, they change the perspectives, include, engage and achieve more with limited resources, in most of the cases by joining community forces. We hope that these examples will motivate other local governments, local practitioners and stakeholders to learn, analyse and scale-up and therefore contribute to the social, economic and cultural rights of their citizens in line with the overarching principle \"Leave no one behind\" of the 2030 Agenda.</p>\r\n<p><em>***</em></p>\r\n<p><em>The project “Enhancing local capacities to implement the 2030 Agenda and the “Leave No One Behind” Principle” is realised with the financial support of the project “Social Rights for Vulnerable Groups II (SoRi II)”, implemented by GIZ, in partnership with NALAS, within the program “Strengthening Good Governance in the Western Balkan Countries”. </em></p>\r\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\r\n<p title=\"Inclusive social approaches - good practices of South-East Europe municipalities\"><a href=\"http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/ISASEE\"><img src=\"http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> Inclusive social approaches - good practices of South-East Europe municipalities</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-2021FR.png"], "file_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/ISASEE"], "files": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/ISASEE", "path": "ISASEE", "checksum": "5f1612cace83acb5d199c997f28ab32d", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Home/Download/ISASEE"}], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg", "path": "low-social1.jpg", "checksum": "dd9c28f4af95cf1006a3f7700a1b7b84", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png", "path": "low-genderswm.png", "checksum": "32c9f8a96541ab54b98fe8f73de06b5c", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png", "path": "low-grbbp.png", "checksum": "3894ebfb0ad4585eecb6b8c2adc81ab1", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-2021FR.png", "path": "low-2021FR.png", "checksum": "2e30c5477f8f5d47738564ef637b10e4", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-2021FR.png"}]},,

The EU, in its Energy Efficiency Directive, foresees an exemplary role of the public sector in this regard and views private investment as the main driving force for reaching the aspired breadth and depth of renovation. Public sector engagement is necessary for doing the groundwork, such as preparing sound renovation strategies that can guide private investment or raise awareness of the various benefits of renovations to elicit higher consumer demand.</p>\r\n<p>This guide is developed within the Project EmBuild - Empower public authorities to establish a long-term strategy for mobilizing investment in the energy efficient renovation of the building stock. It presents possible measures for improving the awareness of benefits of applying energy efficiency measures and deep renovation in public buildings at local level. It includes measures of a more general nature as well as country-specific recommendations. The main objective of this document is to present existing and/ or innovative approaches/mechanisms for active involvement of stakeholders at public level and to facilitate and stimulate application of such awareness raising measures in practice. The focus of EmBuild lies at the local level. Thus, measures are identified with a distinct local (municipal) and regional (county or district) application.</p>\r\n<p>The recommendations and suggestions in this guide are aimed at local energy efficiency practitioners such as energy managers, energy officers, other experts and personnel involved in planning and applying energy efficiency measures at local level who also have the difficult task to convince the decision makers in benefits of application of energy efficiency measures in public buildings for various reasons (new directives, laws, requirements, budget restrictions, etc.) or interact in their daily practice with the stakeholders who are directly affected or influence the application of the energy efficiency measures (general public, NGOs, building societies, and others).</p>\r\n<p><em>The EmBuild Project receives funding from the Horizon 2020 European Union Research and Innovation Programme under Grant Agreement No 695169.</em></p>\r\n<p title=\"Guide to Raising Awareness at Municipal Level\"><a href=\"/Home/Download/EmBuild_Guide\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> Guide to Raising Awareness at Municipal Level</a></p>\r\n<p title=\"Guide to Raising Awareness at Municipal Level\"> </p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Pic2EmBuild.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png"], "file_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/EmBuild_Guide"], "files": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/EmBuild_Guide", "path": "EmBuild_Guide", "checksum": "56a8433826211a16967799e884e14735", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Home/Download/EmBuild_Guide"}], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Pic2EmBuild.jpg", "path": "low-Pic2EmBuild.jpg", "checksum": "29ceaaccbdd368b698c2d12fae6f5f8e", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-Pic2EmBuild.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg", "path": "low-social1.jpg", "checksum": "dd9c28f4af95cf1006a3f7700a1b7b84", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png", "path": "low-genderswm.png", "checksum": "32c9f8a96541ab54b98fe8f73de06b5c", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png", "path": "low-grbbp.png", "checksum": "3894ebfb0ad4585eecb6b8c2adc81ab1", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png"}]},,

Local and regional governments played an important role in influencing the definition of the SDGs, successfully campaigning for a stand-alone goal on Sustainable Cities and Human Settlements (SDG 11), and for international recognition of the pivotal role of local and regional government in sustainable development.</p>\r\n<p>As the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda must be achieved at global, national and subnational levels, the success of this ambitious agenda is dependent on the active involvement of every level of government and of a large variety of stakeholders. The framework of the SDGs with its universal definition of goals and targets has to be adapted to concrete situations and specific needs to create actual benefits for concrete people and their living conditions. This process of taking into account subnational contexts in the achievement of the 2030 Agenda, is what we understand by “Localising the SDGs”.</p>\r\n<p>Localisation relates both to how the SDGs can provide a framework for local development policy and to how local and regional governments can support the achievement of the SDGs through action from the bottom up. In this respect the capacities of municipal structures to implement the 2030 Agenda and monitor the achievement of SDGs on local level and the involvement of public, private and civil society actors are crucial.</p>\r\n<p>This Handbook has been designed to serve exactly this purpose. To help practitioners at municipal level in improving their knowledge and strengthening their understanding of the relevance of the 2030 agenda and the SDGs at local level, to raise their capacities to become promoters of the SDGs and to be able to sensitise other stakeholders.</p>\r\n<p>The Handbook provides the key information about the SDGs, explains the role of municipalities in their implementation and explores awareness raising tools that municipalities could use to bring SDGs closer to their citizens. The Handbook also provides for a variety of examples from the region and beyond that illustrate what municipalities have done to promote SDGs and how this affected their wellbeing.</p>\r\n<p>The Handbook also provides an advice on integrating SDGs in local strategies and explores the role that LGAs and NALAS play in mobilising municipalities to achieve SDGs.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p title=\"Agenda 2030 in my municipality\">Download the Handbook:</p>\r\n<p title=\"Agenda 2030 in my municipality\"><a href=\"http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/SDGs_Handbook\"><img src=\"http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> Agenda 2030 in my municipality</a></p>\r\n<p title=\"Agenda 2030 in my municipality_ ALB\"><a href=\"/Home/Download/Agenda2030_ALB\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> Agenda 2030 in my municipality_ ALB</a></p>\r\n<p title=\"Agenda 2030 in my municipality_ SRB\"><a href=\"/Home/Download/Agenda2030_SRB\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> Agenda 2030 in my municipality_ SRB</a></p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SDGs_Hand.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png"], "file_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/SDGs_Handbook", "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/Agenda2030_ALB", "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/Agenda2030_SRB"], "files": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/SDGs_Handbook", "path": "SDGs_Handbook", "checksum": "2e1ef358534c2a181b5ea80ef66277b5", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Home/Download/SDGs_Handbook"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/Agenda2030_ALB", "path": "Agenda2030_ALB", "checksum": "c75d096044091e60d5b3c4bb8d924c6a", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Home/Download/Agenda2030_ALB"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/Agenda2030_SRB", "path": "Agenda2030_SRB", "checksum": "90339fe791ce447a78ed7c34ddd509c9", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Home/Download/Agenda2030_SRB"}], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SDGs_Hand.jpg", "path": "low-SDGs_Hand.jpg", "checksum": "d79fd83f24ba89eddae428ef8b4ef23c", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SDGs_Hand.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg", "path": "low-social1.jpg", "checksum": "dd9c28f4af95cf1006a3f7700a1b7b84", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png", "path": "low-genderswm.png", "checksum": "32c9f8a96541ab54b98fe8f73de06b5c", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png", "path": "low-grbbp.png", "checksum": "3894ebfb0ad4585eecb6b8c2adc81ab1", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png"}]},,

The findings of this assessment provide the point of departure for an evidence-based dialogue with the EU Commission’s DG NEAR, the Regional Cooperation Council (RCC) and the WB6 national governments. In this context, the Poznan Summit in July 2019 and its side events will be the ideal platform for such an exchange.</p>\r\n<p>The report’s objective was to assess the involvement of local governments and local government issues in the MAP/RIRA and make recommendations for the better inclusion of local governments’ concerns. Hence, the assessment’s central task consisted in analyzing gaps in the MAP REA/RIRA with respect to local governments’ positions and involvement in the further implementation of the MAP REA/RIRA process.</p>\r\n<p>As a general conclusion, it was possible to observe <strong>a general lack of local government interests and local economic development</strong> and low representation of direct approaches for local governments’ roles and action settings.</p>\r\n<p>The evaluation resulted in 47 designated fields. Only one was assessed as “sufficiently covering local concerns”. 23 were assessed as “not sufficiently covering local concerns” in the MAP REA/RIRA, whereas the remaining “do not cover local concerns at all”.</p>\r\n<p>Based on the assessment, a total of 9 recommendations for improving MAP REA and 16 recommendations for NALAS and Regional Cooperation Council (RCC) action were presented.</p>\r\n<p>The assessment was conducted and the report produced by a team of the KDZ-Centre for Public Administration Research from Vienna, Austria.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>To download the report:</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p title='“Potential Contributions of SEE Local Governments to the Regional Economic Area\"'><a href=\"/Home/Download/MAPREA3\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> “Potential Contributions of SEE Local Governments to the Regional Economic Area\"</a></p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-MAPREA.PNG", "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png"], "file_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/MAPREA3"], "files": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/MAPREA3", "path": "MAPREA3", "checksum": "bb9d165b085a56e7dbf5cf4f1494b7bc", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Home/Download/MAPREA3"}], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-MAPREA.PNG", "path": "low-MAPREA.PNG", "checksum": "1a1241207dd864cd54d2fe4e720e59dd", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-MAPREA.PNG"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg", "path": "low-social1.jpg", "checksum": "dd9c28f4af95cf1006a3f7700a1b7b84", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png", "path": "low-genderswm.png", "checksum": "32c9f8a96541ab54b98fe8f73de06b5c", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png", "path": "low-grbbp.png", "checksum": "3894ebfb0ad4585eecb6b8c2adc81ab1", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png"}]},,

The first reviews the data used in the report and discusses some basic methodological issues. The second provides an overview of the structure and functions of municipal governments in the region. The third section examines selected indicators of macro–economic performance and fiscal decentralisation. The fourth one focuses on the evolution of intergovernmental finances in each NALAS’ member country or entity.</p>\r\n<p>The main findings of the Report are the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>There is an ongoing tendency of concentration of people in capital and metropolitan cities, despite the region’s diversity in terms of territorial organization. </strong>In Albania, Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro over 20% of the population lives in the capital cities, which creates significant pressures and challenges for improved service delivery and intergovernmental finance systems.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Local government challenges to provide better services and improve the quality of life of citizens are exacerbated by a general stagnation or deterioration of local finance arrangements </strong>that are not able to keep up or quickly respond to local government needs and developments.</li>\r\n<li>While it is difficult to judge the adequacy of local government revenues relative to their expenditure needs, there seems little question that <strong>in many places in the region municipalities are underfunded, and central governments are not giving them a fair share of the overall fiscal pie</strong>. On average, in 2017, SEE local government revenue as a share of GDP stood at 5.9%, almost half of their counterparts in the EU that benefit from an average of 10.7%.</li>\r\n<li><strong>The level of local fiscal autonomy is decreasing in many SEE countries</strong>. On average local government revenues in SEE decreased by 0.5% between 2015 and 2017, both as a percent of the GDP and Total Public Revenues. Further, compared to 2006, NALAS’s baseline year, the <strong>share of revenues over which local governments can exercise independent decision-making has decreased, </strong>while the share of conditional block grants and specific-purpose investment grants has increased by 50% and 30% respectively.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Local government powers to</strong> <strong>set and collect taxes, fees and charges are in continuous change </strong>– sometimes without a due process of consultation and/or compensation, under the general expectations of improved business climate and relieved fiscal burdens to taxpayers that would result in more job-creation. Unfortunately, this depresses local governments efforts too.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Regardless of level of development and membership to the EU, SEE local governments continue to face similar challenges as regards to own revenue generation</strong>, including the frequent and continuous amendment of the legal framework; outdated fiscal registers; weak tax compliance and enforcement, while commitment of policymakers to make local taxation effective is critical everywhere in the region.</li>\r\n<li>Additionally,<strong> there seems to be an inverse relationship between the level of decentralisation measured by the scope of the social functions devolved to the local governments and the size of the public sector</strong>. The data suggests that surprisingly decentralisation has gone furthest in places where the overall public sector is relatively small, and to minor extent where potentially national governments face significant trouble collecting taxes.</li>\r\n<li><strong>The functional allocation of expenditures shows that SEE local governments spend most of their budgets on Education</strong> and <strong>Housing and Community Amenities:</strong> Education takes 40-60% of municipal budgets in Moldova, Slovenia, Kosovo and Bulgaria - which is 2-3 times more than the EU28 average. In Albania, Croatia and Turkey, local governments spend one quarter to one third of all expenditures on housing and community amenities. <strong>Environmental protection is the function where almost all SEE countries spend the least</strong>.</li>\r\n<li><strong>SEE local governments spend, on average, a third of their budgets on personnel wages/salaries costs</strong> which is almost equal to the EU and<strong>, while the share of spending for capital investments is, on average, twice as much as their counterparts in the EU</strong>. The report provides a comprehensive analysis of the spending patterns of SEE as a region and individual countries, including historic data from 2006, both as a percent of the total, in million Euro or in Euro per capita.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition to providing information on the status and development of the intergovernmental finance systems in SEE, this edition puts more emphasis on service responsibilities of local governments and their revenue raising capacities, identifying the major developments and challenges faced by local governments as regards to the collection of local taxes, fees and charges.</p>\r\n<p>The report publishes for the first time the allocation of local expenditures according to the Classification of the Functions of Government Methodology (COFOG)<a href=\"http://www.nalas.eu/News/FD_2018#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a>, showing not only what SEE local governments do but also what their spending priorities are. Additionally, the report, for the first time includes data in terms of <em>millions of euro</em> and <em>in Euro per capita terms</em>, which will certainly be of help for analysts, practitioners and policymakers to better understand the situation in each country and prepare their own even more detailed analysis.</p>\r\n<p>For downloading the full Report:</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://nalas.eu/Home/Download/FD_rep2018x\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> 2018 Fiscal Decentralisation Report</a></div>\r\n<div class=\"description col-md-12\">\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nalas.eu/News/FD_2018#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a> The <strong>Classification of the functions of government (COFOG)</strong> was developed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and published by the United Nations Statistical Division as a standard classifying the purposes of government activities around the world.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p title=\"2018 Fiscal Decentralisation Report\"> </p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-FDR1.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png"], "file_urls": ["http://nalas.eu/Home/Download/FD_rep2018x"], "files": [{"url": "http://nalas.eu/Home/Download/FD_rep2018x", "path": "FD_rep2018x", "checksum": "4e3736356c6711c43d1b79b266e0867c", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Home/Download/FD_rep2018x"}], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-FDR1.jpg", "path": "low-FDR1.jpg", "checksum": "9438b9516b630a64b2a72211abd264dd", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-FDR1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg", "path": "low-social1.jpg", "checksum": "dd9c28f4af95cf1006a3f7700a1b7b84", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png", "path": "low-genderswm.png", "checksum": "32c9f8a96541ab54b98fe8f73de06b5c", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png", "path": "low-grbbp.png", "checksum": "3894ebfb0ad4585eecb6b8c2adc81ab1", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png"}]},,

The document, among others, addresses relevant sector policy frameworks, presents best practice examples, financing options and opportunities for the region’s countries. It also integrates gender mainstreaming in SUM, while providing a clear understanding of the local and regional context of energy efficiency and environmental protection in the transport sector, including of the importance of a holistic approach in the field of urban mobility planning. It outlines common activities the region’s cities should implement in proactively supporting the development of SUM in SEE.</p>\r\n<p>Download the handbook at:</p>\r\n<p title=\"EN SUMSEEC

The South-East Europe region faces vast socio-economic challenges, while the economic consolidation is slow and only reaches part of the population. Those suffering the consequences are primarily the vulnerable groups, such as persons with disabilities, economically disadvantaged people, residents of rural areas, single parents, elderly, young people, ethnic minorities as well as women and girls. Traditional roles, prejudices against ethnic minorities, and exclusion of people with disabilities are anchored deep in the society and influence the political discourse.</p>\r\n<p>Many citizens belonging to the vulnerable groups lack knowledge about their social rights and access to social services, education, and healthcare. On the other hand, municipalities and other relevant stakeholders that need to bridge this gap often face the lack of knowledge and competencies, as well as insufficient financial resources. In addition, the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its 17 development goals, and especially the “Leave No One Behind” principle, enjoys little attention among the authorities and is progressing slowly.</p>\r\n<p>In the frame of NALAS’ project “Enhancing local capacities to implement the 2030 Agenda and the “Leave No One Behind” Principle”, 12 municipalities went a step further, learned and implemented different social inclusion approaches that ensured inclusion of the most vulnerable ones.</p>\r\n<p>This booklet presents these 12 good practices on provision of social services to the left behind communities piloted by local governments throughout the region. The practices were developed in the frame of the regional peer-to-peer exchange learning clusters on social inclusion approaches, managed by NALAS’ member associations <a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\"></a>from the target economies, supported by resource persons.</p>\r\n<p>The practices are presented in five chapters related to the five social inclusion approaches:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Day-care centre;</li>\r\n<li>Minority inclusion models (social dialogue forum and minority commissioner);</li>\r\n<li>Mobile outreach teams;</li>\r\n<li>Raising the awareness on the rights of the vulnerable groups; and</li>\r\n<li>Inclusive disaster risk management.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>All of the 12 practices are inspirational, they change the perspectives, include, engage and achieve more with limited resources, in most of the cases by joining community forces. We hope that these examples will motivate other local governments, local practitioners and stakeholders to learn, analyse and scale-up and therefore contribute to the social, economic and cultural rights of their citizens in line with the overarching principle \"Leave no one behind\" of the 2030 Agenda.</p>\r\n<p><em>***</em></p>\r\n<p><em>The project “Enhancing local capacities to implement the 2030 Agenda and the “Leave No One Behind” Principle” is realised with the financial support of the project “Social Rights for Vulnerable Groups II (SoRi II)”, implemented by GIZ, in partnership with NALAS, within the program “Strengthening Good Governance in the Western Balkan Countries”. </em></p>\r\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p title=\"Inclusive social approaches - good practices of South-East Europe municipalities\"><a href=\"/Home/Download/ISASEE\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> Inclusive social approaches - good practices of South-East Europe municipalities</a></p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/ISASEE"], "files": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/ISASEE", "path": "ISASEE", "checksum": "5f1612cace83acb5d199c997f28ab32d", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Home/Download/ISASEE"}], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg", "path": "low-social1.jpg", "checksum": "dd9c28f4af95cf1006a3f7700a1b7b84", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

NALAS in cooperation with KDZ is going to boost and support the Digitalization of Cities in the next years and will bring together those responsible for digitalization in the local government associations and cities.</p>\r\n<p>The initial step will be to <strong>analyse digital challenges and elaborate on potentials </strong>for SEE local governments to support the digitalization of local public services and in developing “smart cities”.</p>\r\n<p>Due to Covid19 pandemic the need for digitalization of local governments and public services has been dramatically increased. The NALAS study “Impact of Covid19 in SEE Local Governments” from summer 2020 gave first insights of the need for the further development towards smart digitalization. To guarantee that the differentiated needs and requirements of the member countries concerning local smart digitalization are properly recognized, each LGA (NALAS member) has nominated a local digitalization officer. They will take part in the capacity development activities and at the same time contribute with local and national expertise concerning smart local digitalization.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks to the support of BACID I and II, NALAS was able to expand its impact in the structure of multi-level governance in the Region and vis-à-vis national governments. The Fiscal Decentralization Reports, the Regional Decentralization Observatory, the Budget Transparency Platform (Nalas Observatory) are main products of the BACID II support which need to be quality assured and safeguarded through BACID III.</p>\r\n<p>The well-established competence of AACT and Austrian cities in this area will hereby play a key role.

It represents a first attempt by NALAS to assemble from its member associations basic data on fiscal decentralization. Over time, NALAS hopes to expand and deepen the analysis in response to requests and suggestions from both member associations and interested observers. For the moment, however, the report provides a snap shot of the structure, functions, and financing of local governments in South East Europe, as well as an overview of how intergovernmental financial relations have evolved over the economically turbulent period 2006-2010. <br><br>The report is divided into four sections. It begins with a brief discussion of the data and some of the methodological issues surrounding its use and interpretation. It then presents basic information about the size and structure of municipal governments in South East Europe, as well a few key macro-economic indicators. The report continues by examining the composition of local government revenues and expenditures and concludes with a few observations about trends over the last five years.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p title=\"NALAS-FDIndicators\"><a href=\"/Home/Download/NALAS-FDIndicators\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> NALAS-FDIndicators</a></p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-fdreport.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png"], "file_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/NALAS-FDIndicators"], "files": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/NALAS-FDIndicators", "path": "NALAS-FDIndicators", "checksum": "81814e9615ec92a82ae932d66d48f527", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Home/Download/NALAS-FDIndicators"}], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-fdreport.png", "path": "low-fdreport.png", "checksum": "3f9a4ee02efff7e58fed82e96257ca49", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-fdreport.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg", "path": "low-social1.jpg", "checksum": "dd9c28f4af95cf1006a3f7700a1b7b84", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png", "path": "low-genderswm.png", "checksum": "32c9f8a96541ab54b98fe8f73de06b5c", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png", "path": "low-grbbp.png", "checksum": "3894ebfb0ad4585eecb6b8c2adc81ab1", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png"}]},,

The need for municipalities and Public Utility Companies (PUCs) to undertake efforts in order to provide services as efficient and affordable as possible is therefore clear. In order to improve service levels in municipal waste management policy at the local level, efficiency and quality must be enhanced under the umbrella of an affordable tariff structure. This makes continual analysis and planning essential. Service level evaluation, performance indicator comparison and planning needs require the development of standardized solid waste management calculation tools based on up-to-date information. The harmonisation of the information required for processing and comparison purposes is crucial, and is mirrored in the needs of waste management information tools. It is commonly recognized that solid waste management in South East Europe is weakened by the lack of reliable data at local, institutional and national level. The SWIS model is a tool designed for municipal waste management data collection and analysis and is intended for use by public entities in charge for the provision of this service. It will help local governments to collect and process relevant data on the most important questions in municipal waste management.</p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-knc804.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-knc804.jpg", "path": "low-knc804.jpg", "checksum": "bf121ddccb27e58a748f36f1494ac213", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-knc804.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg", "path": "low-social1.jpg", "checksum": "dd9c28f4af95cf1006a3f7700a1b7b84", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png", "path": "low-genderswm.png", "checksum": "32c9f8a96541ab54b98fe8f73de06b5c", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png", "path": "low-grbbp.png", "checksum": "3894ebfb0ad4585eecb6b8c2adc81ab1", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png"}]},,

Challenges of regularisation of informal settlements of thirteen entities with diverse backgrounds in terms of economic management and political structure were assesed. Almost all are currently at different stages of a major socioeconomic transition which imposes new challenges for all sectors of economic management. Rapid urban growth has generated a dramatic increase in the need for land, services, credit and livelihood opportunities. Understandably, local governments have found it difficult to keep pace with the complexity and scale of these needs.

This edition extends the period under review through 2011, and deepens certain aspects of the analysis. In particular, more analysis has been done on local government spending and on the effects of the global recession --now complicated by uncertainty about European Union’s future—on the region.<br><br>The report provides a reliable snap shot of the structure, functions, and financing of local governments in South-East Europe today, as well as an overview of how intergovernmental financial relations have evolved over the economically turbulent period 2006-2011. It is our expectation that the report will be useful to NALAS’ member associations, as well as to the more general policy community by providing all concerned with reliable data on the role of municipal governments in region, as well in comparison with their counterparts in the EU. <br><br>The report is divided into four sections. It begins with a brief discussion of the data and some of the methodological issues surrounding its use and interpretation. It then presents basic information about the size and structure of municipal governments in South-East Europe, as well a few key macro-economic indicators. The report continues by examining the composition of local government revenues and expenditures and concludes with a few observations about trends over the last six years.</p>\r\n<p

Therefore, the procedural rules of budget negotiation between the National Association of local governments and the Ministry of Finance are extremely significant tools in achieving fiscal objectives and protecting municipal interest in the course of drafting the annual national budget act. The recommendations presented in this publication were elaborated by the NAMRB Expert Team, with support of other NALAS members.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nalas.eu/Publications/Books/Declaration-on-Budget-Negotiations\">Publication website</a></p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-knc622.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-knc622.jpg", "path": "low-knc622.jpg", "checksum": "a423c0ed8afbbf8f540fffc840888c39", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-knc622.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg", "path": "low-social1.jpg", "checksum": "dd9c28f4af95cf1006a3f7700a1b7b84", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png", "path": "low-genderswm.png", "checksum": "32c9f8a96541ab54b98fe8f73de06b5c", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png", "path": "low-grbbp.png", "checksum": "3894ebfb0ad4585eecb6b8c2adc81ab1", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png"}]},,

The overall goal of the project is to improve the local governments’ negotiation position during fiscal planning and budget implementation process. More specifically the project aims to improve the responsiveness of intergovernmental transfers on municipal priorities, to make grant allocation more transparent and more predictable and to establish clear fiscal equalization system. The project was lead by the expert team of the National Association of Municipalities of the Republic of Bulgaria (NAMRB).</p>\r\n<p>The targeted audience of these recommendations is primarily the countries of Southern-Eastern Europe, where typically local government associations are strong, large and unified ones. Most of the techniques proposed here will work only in these unitary states with one tier local government system. We focused mostly on the annual budget preparation process, so the local government association’s role in the budget implementation, amendment of the annual budget and tax laws, in budget reporting, etc. are not discussed here.</p>\r\n<p>A continual, institutionalized dialogue between national and local governments is critical for the stable and healthy development of any decentralized political order. At the same time, however, it is important to recognize that the goal of reformers in decentralizing societies should be to remove as many critical financial issues from annual negotiations as possible, and in particular to separate to the greatest degree possible the determination of the national budget from the actual planning of local government budgets.</p>\r\n<p>The best way to do this is to have a Law on Local Government Finance that specifies in permanent framework legislation the following:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The nature and type of all local government own fees, charges and taxes and the nature of their rate setting powers.</li>\r\n<li>All shared taxes and the methods (rates, formulae) at which they will be shared with local governments.</li>\r\n<li>The nature of all categorical grants (earmarked, block grants) for permanent delegated or devolved functions (like primary education).</li>\r\n<li>The nature of all general grants, including equalization grants.</li>\r\n<li>The nature and procedures by which all categorical grants for specific (one time) purposes will be determined and allocated.</li>\r\n<li>The nature of any debt limitations to remove these limitations from annual discussion and to avoid the need for the pre approval municipal loan or bond issues by the Ministry of Finance.</li>\r\n<li>The law shoulf require the Ministry of Finance to submit to the Municipal Association(s) by the middle of the second quarter of every fiscal year information on the revenue and expenditures for the previous fiscal year.</li>\r\n<li>The law should require the creation of a negotiation forum and mechanisms.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Read more in the publication below:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"/Home/Download/fullreport\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> Click here to read the complete report</a></p>\r\n<p><a title=\"How to Lead Successful Budget Negotiations?\" href=\"http://www.nalas.eu/Publications/Books/Declaration-on-Budget-Negotiations\" target=\"\">Click here to read the Declaration on Budget Negotiations</a></p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png"], "file_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/fullreport"], "files": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/fullreport", "path": "fullreport", "checksum": "840101b3acde57678acf00dabfec3266", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Home/Download/fullreport"}], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg", "path": "low-social1.jpg", "checksum": "dd9c28f4af95cf1006a3f7700a1b7b84", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-social1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png", "path": "low-genderswm.png", "checksum": "32c9f8a96541ab54b98fe8f73de06b5c", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-genderswm.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png", "path": "low-grbbp.png", "checksum": "3894ebfb0ad4585eecb6b8c2adc81ab1", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png"}]},,

This is the fourth edition of the Report prepared by the NALAS Fiscal Decentralization Task Force, as an ongoing effort to provide national and local policy-makers and analysts with reliable comparative data on municipal finances and intergovernmental fiscal relations in South-East Europe.</p>\r\n<div class=\"description col-md-12\">\r\n<p>As before, we present a comparative picture of what has been happening in the region as a whole, but with increasing focus on monitoring the intergovernmental finances of individual countries. The report provides a reasonably clear picture of the structure, functions, and financing of local governments in South-East Europe today, as well as an overview of how intergovernmental financial relations have evolved over the economically turbulent period 2006-2013. The report has been used by member associations to argue for policy changes at home. It has also provided input for the design of the monitoring system of the regional strategy South East Europe 2020.</p>\r\n<p>The report is divided into three sections. The first discusses the data used in the report and some basic methodological issues. The second begins with a review of the structure and functions of municipal governments in South-East Europe, as well as a few important macro-economic indicators. It then presents comparative indicators of fiscal decentralization for the region as whole.

The Best Practices were gathered through a questionnaire, designed to collect information about the implementation of past GRB practices at local level.</p>\r\n<p>The objective is for this Compendium to serve as a learning tool for local level officials and GRB practitioners. For this purpose, the GRB best-practices gathered and documented in this publication will be stored in the NALAS knowledge tree, GRB best practice database. In addition, the collection of case studies is published on NALAS website and is offered as a resource through the E-Academy and its GRB e-learning course2 . The desired outcome is for local officials and GRB practitioners to learn and possibly replicate these proven approaches or get inspired for innovating new ones.</p>\r\n<p>The Compendium encompasses 17 best practices from 9 economies of the region: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Republic of Moldova, Turkey, Slovenia and Serbia. The practices are related to the following areas: gender participation, women’s economic empowerment, gender-based violence, sports, balancing work and life, and urban planning. The Best Practices are collected by NALAS gender associates and in cooperation with NALAS member associations of local authorities in the course of 2021. The publication also presents GRB champions – local practitioners, individuals who either work in the municipality or in municipal body/enterprise, or are representative of Civil Society Organizations (CSO) that contributed to the implementation of the Best Practice. The methodology for collection of good practices and editing of information on good practices was provided by Ms. Marija Risteska, NALAS Regional Gender Expert.</p>\r\n<p>This publication is part of NALAS project “Promoting e-learning and regional knowledge base development on gender-responsive budgeting”, supported in the framework of UN Women project “Promoting Gender Responsive Polices and Budgets: Towards Transparent, Inclusive and Accountable Governance in the Republic of North Macedonia”, financed by Switzerland and Sweden.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p title=\"Compendium of Gender Responsive Budgeting Best Practices\"><a href=\"http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/GRB_Comp\"><img src=\"http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> Compendium of Gender Responsive Budgeting Best Practices</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/GRB_Comp"], "files": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/GRB_Comp", "path": "GRB_Comp", "checksum": "ba2473799f79ba37d8dfbce70eee05ba", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Home/Download/GRB_Comp"}], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png", "path": "low-grbbp.png", "checksum": "3894ebfb0ad4585eecb6b8c2adc81ab1", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-grbbp.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

It brings together the global knowledge of the UN Agencies and NALAS’ expertise coming from the national Local Government Associations, as knowledge hubs for local governments”</em>, said <strong>Mr. Kelmend Zajazi</strong>, NALAS Executive Director in his opening speech. <em>“Local governments throughout the region face many challenges related to their local assets. We have inherited old public infrastructure and are striving to improve it to improve public services and quality of life. But it is not enough, we also need to better manage the existing assets”</em>, said Mr. Zajazi.    </p>\r\n<p title=\"amw2\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//amw2.jpg\" alt=\"amw2\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The workshop brought together 27 representatives from municipalities and local government associations from 12 economies across South-East Europe, including the <strong>City of Sofia, Tirana, Podgorica, Velenje, Lezha, Kocaeli, Kumanovo, Laktasi, Edinet and Colibasi</strong>.

Each day consisted of short live/video lectures, interactive exercises and in-person activities.

Both projects aim to enhance capacities of local stakeholders with regard to the inclusion of minorities and other disadvantaged groups based on the Leave-No-One-Behind principle and successful social approaches applied in the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein.</p>\r\n<p>As implementing partners, the State Chancellery of the Federal State of Schleswig-Holstein was represented by Ms. Linda Pieper from the Department of National Minorities, Ms. Fenna Oldendoerp (GIZ-Hamburg), Mr. Petrit Sopjani (GIZ-Kosovo) and NALAS Secretariat (Joachim Roth).</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//dm7..png\" alt=\"dm7.\" width=\"400\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//dm8..png\" alt=\"dm8.\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The online event brought together over 60 local government representatives, experts and practitioners, who explored the benefits that inclusion of vulnerable groups and diversity as a management tool and concept bring to the community. Information, experience and expertise about the contribution of DM was shared regarding benefits for local planning and implementation processes, stakeholders’ involvement, as well as challenges associated with sustainability. The webinar was hosted by the Network of Associations of Local Authorities of South East Europe - NALAS.</p>\r\n<p>Diversity is a complex and an evolving concept that encompasses a wide array of categories. The approach goes beyond the conventional demographic categories of people and includes various collective and individual markers, on the basis of which identity is constructed, from socio-economic class to lifestyles and hobbies. </p>\r\n<p>The interlocutors pointed out that the notion of Diversity management is often applied to different sets of policy approaches and tools for shaping and regulating social relations (Dr. Zora Popova) and is seen both as an approach and a system which appeared as a new concept in the mid-1980 within the business community and then reached out to the public sector.</p>\r\n<p>One of the highlights of the event was without doubt the presentation of good practice examples from the Western Balkans (municipalities of Bitola and Delcevo, North Macedonia) and the Federal State of Schleswig-Holstein. The shared experiences demonstrated the benefits that DM brings about with regard to social cohesion, improved problem-solving capacities, ownership, increased innovation and better decision-making by involving all groups regardless of age, sex, gender, race, culture, language, religion, belonging, physical/mental capacities. It is in diversity, by applying the whole-of-society approach, where the added value of inclusion lies for a truly sustainable development where No-One and No-Territory is left behind.</p>\r\n<p>Ms. Simona Jovevska, Advisor for Social Services for vulnerable groups from the Municipality of Bitola in North Macedonia, presented the results of the social mapping process conducted and the important steps towards inclusion policy in the Municipality of Bitola.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//dm4..png\" alt=\"dm4.\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Representing the cross-departmental personnel marketing and junior staff campaign, of the State Chancellery of the Federal State of Schleswig-Holstein, Ms. Nurdan Kilic, gave a comprehensive overview of activities to acquire young talents from all groups forming the social tissue of this most northern state of Germany know for its successful minority inclusion policy.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//dm5..png\" alt=\"dm5.\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The success story of the municipality of Delcevo (North Macedonia) in its effort towards inclusion was shared by Ms. Suzana Petrovska, Advisor for Employment &amp; Human Resources, putting in the spotlight the step-by-step development process of its Social Plan and the set-up of relevant entities to represent the interests and necessities of all social groups.</p>\r\n<p> <img src=\"/Files/Galleries//dm3..png\" alt=\"dm3.\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Diversity Managements experts, Ms. Gordana Nestorovska and Mr. Memet Memeti explained the concept of Diversity Management, objectives and related topics, advantages for municipalities from implementing the DM concept/approach, initiatives at local level and key factors for successful upgrade of the existing practices to DM.</p>\r\n<p>For municipalities in our region “Diversity management is a holistic approach that encompasses all approaches and existing inclusion mechanisms for different groups and thus fulfilling an existing gap at local level towards integration”, highlighted Ms. Nestorovska. In this context, Dr. Memeti underlined that Diversity management, although being a relevant area of concern within government structures at national and local level to create social justice and to eliminate discrimination against minorities, is a governance tool largely absent in the range of public services and lacks general attention as a notion.</p>\r\n<p>The final part was reserved for the immediate project outlook and next steps regarding activities related to social rights for vulnerable groups coordinated by GIZ and NALAS for the period 2023-2025. Mr. Boran Ivanoski, NALAS project coordinator, gave an overview of the third phase of the SoRI project: “Regional cooperation for better social inclusion at local level”</p>\r\n<p title=\"dm6.\"><img

The report provides a comparative overview and then a detailed analysis of the local government responsibilities in education, social care and protection and public health in South-East Europe, how they are regulated, managed and financed for all South-East European economies.</p>\r\n<p>As the world continues to face the aftermath of COVID-19 and local governments lead recovery efforts, a special chapter is dedicated the <strong>municipal response to COVID-19 in the social sector in South-East Europe</strong>. This chapter shows what South-East European local governments have been doing to weather the crisis impact in education, social protection and care and public health.</p>\r\n<p>The report introduces the <strong>NALAS Decentralisation Observatory</strong> – the data and information hub on local government issues in South-East Europe (<a href=\"http://www.nalas-observatory.eu)\">www.nalas-observatory.eu)</a>. The Observatory facilitates the access to and utilisation of timely, accurate, reliable and comparable data and information on local government finance in South-East Europe (SEE). The Observatory is developed by NALAS, in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.kdz.eu/en\">KDZ</a> – Centre for Public Administration Research and with the support of the <a href=\"https://www.bacid.eu/BACID_-_Building_Administrative_Capacities_in_the_Danube_Region\">BACID Program</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Ultimately, the report includes also its traditional analysis on Fiscal Decentralisation providing an <strong>overview of fiscal decentralization tendencies in South-East Europe</strong> and then specific chapters with fiscal decentralisation indicators for the individual economies.</p>\r\n<p>The report is structured in five key chapters:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Comparative overview of local social sector responsibilities in South-East Europe</li>\r\n<li>Municipal response to COVID-19 in the social sector in South-East Europe</li>\r\n<li>Review of decentralised social sector responsibilities in South-East Europe</li>\r\n<li>Overview of fiscal decentralisation in South-East Europe</li>\r\n<li>Key fiscal decentralisation indicators in South-East Europe</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>We are profoundly grateful to the NALAS Fiscal Decentralisation Task Force (FDTF) members for their invaluable support and for the efforts they made to both gather very specific data and synthesise the complicated roles their local governments play in managing and financing social sector services in South-East Europe. We are equally grateful for the extra effort they made to add to the report short sections on the impact of, and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by local governments in the social sector.</p>\r\n<p>We hope this report will be helpful to NALAS member Local Government Associations and policymakers, experts and practitioners in SEE, in informing and supporting their advocacy efforts for improved policies, services and financing of local governments social sector responsibilities and beyond.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the full Report:</strong></p>\r\n<p title=\"8th NALAS Fiscal Decentralisation Indicators Report\"><a href=\"http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/8_FDR\"><img src=\"http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> 8th NALAS Fiscal Decentralisation Indicators Report</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-2021FR.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/8_FDR"], "files": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/8_FDR", "path": "8_FDR", "checksum": "6447e99550f50a730ef47b0576462b8f", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Home/Download/8_FDR"}], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-2021FR.png", "path": "low-2021FR.png", "checksum": "2e30c5477f8f5d47738564ef637b10e4", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-2021FR.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

At the beginning, the priority was to provide members with the relevant information on adjusting and dealing with the pandemics, followed by needs assessments and tailoring appropriate CD services, mostly delivered virtually.</p>\r\n<p>Also, the associations adjusted their CD programmes based on the needs, putting an emphasis on the water safety and crisis management programmes. Some of them equipped appropriate studios for online teaching, used both for virtual and hybrid events. The two regional water conferences organised by Shukalb/Shukos and UoMM/AWM survived all the challenges and were successfully organised these two years.</p>\r\n<p title=\"rcdnnm4\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//rcdnnm4.png\" alt=\"rcdnnm4\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Although missing and preferring face to face interactions, participants agreed that virtual is not going to leave. Therefore, they have done the necessary adjustments and equipped their organisations and staff to use it in the most effective way. Transferring data on cloud, trainings for digital skills for staff and trainers, assisting members to advance their digital skills, equipping training studios, offering e-learning courses, online knowledge management platforms, developing tools for online decision-making, diversifying online tools used, adjusting training programmes, were some of the changes that associations made to meet the new reality.  </p>\r\n<p title=\"rcdnnm6\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//rcdnnm6.png\" alt=\"rcdnnm6\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><em>“Here, a blessing in disguise, we were very lucky to be a part of the RCDN team in these hard times. Firstly, they supported us in providing necessary equipment and other technical support in order to make only the basis for further improvement of CD delivery. The team prepared a set of measures for all members of the Network for delivering online trainings. Guides, manuals, thematic trainings for preparing and delivering online trainings…. are just some of the set of activities”</em>, said Ms. Jelena Borozan from the Union of Municipalities of Montenegro. <em>“And what is important to emphasize is that all of these were not only for FP as organizers, but for the facilitators and trainers, as well. With this, our knowledge was/is improved, our capacities are strengthened, and we decided to jump into the fire and start organizing our first online events. I have to mention that being an organizer of online events is significantly different than being “on the other side”, as a participant”</em>, concluded Ms. Borozan. </p>\r\n<p title=\"rcdnnm5\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//rcdnnm5.png\" alt=\"rcdnnm5\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><em>“In the past several years of cooperation, we, as RCDN partner Associations have generated a lot of experience in Capacity Development, water and sanitation services, but also in organisation management”</em>, said Ms. Jelena Janevska, RCDN Knowledge Manager from NALAS. <em>“As one of the key values of regional cooperation, we would like to see this knowledge shared among the members of the Network, enhancing their capacities and empowering them to do more and better.

If Europe wants to be close to its future citizens, then <strong>it has to go local</strong>. The EU is about people, for people and around people. The location where people live, act, meet and liaise directly with government and public administration is the local level! A functional bottom-up approach depends on an effective coordination and cooperation between local and central government level by actively involving the citizens concerned and by promoting the inclusive partnership principle to be successful.” </em>– emphasized Mr. Raičević during his address.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, Mr. Raičević added that the experience shows that when it comes to the enlargement process LAs have not been considered as a key layer of governance which they, in fact are, neither as primary beneficiaries. The local authorities have not been properly involved in the planning of the pre-accession assistance, and did not have many opportunities to implement their actions through EU funding mechanisms.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, <em>“Major global challenges like the COVID pandemic, the refugee/migration crisis and climate change demonstrated, are best addressed collectively at all levels of government. The <strong>inclusive partnership principle</strong> between all levels of governance is a MUST in order to deal with these complex global issues and to provide an effective and swift response. In this context, the crucial role of LAs to contribute to confront and mitigate causes and effects of these sweeping challenges is crucial. It is here at the local level where the ‘Leave no one behind principle’ of the 2030 Agenda is adhered to via coordinated and joint action.”</em> – highlighted the NALAS Vice President.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Raicevic1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Raicevic1.png", "path": "low-Raicevic1.png", "checksum": "22c8060530d00d77b04786cffd77ae83", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-Raicevic1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

On the one side, SEE local governments’ spending has increased to respond to the crisis and support their local communities. On the other side, their revenues have been falling down because of the lockdown, the fall in economic activity, consumption and jobs, the closure of certain local services and utilities, and also because of the fiscal relief measures adopted to support local economies and individuals.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, at the peak of the crisis and during the “lockdown” (March-June 2020) local revenues were severely hit - in 81 % of SEE, local governments’ own revenues decreased by more than 10% and 20% in annual terms. In the same time, also intergovernmental transfers fell for 65%. As a result, local capital investments fell by more than 20% in more than a third of SEE local governments.</p>\r\n<p>Last but not least, Mr. Beočanin highlighted the challenges in local finances which according to the NALAS survey are expected to continue over the short and medium term. Most SEE local governments expect a pessimistic or very pessimistic outlook for the years 2020 to 2022. Overall, cumulatively, by 2022 SEE local governments may lose up to 30% of their revenues compared to 2019 for a total estimated loss of 17 billion Euro, which would have devastating effects for local governments and will compromise their ability to provide services and improve infrastructure.</p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-JCCSr.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-JCCSr.jpg", "path": "low-JCCSr.jpg", "checksum": "6b4814fcb67b345c155c7a54fe6e5015", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-JCCSr.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

Mr. Manolov emphasized that SEE local governments remain at the forefront in responding to this crisis.</p>\r\n<p>“<em>In a recent NALAS Study we looked at the impact of COVID-19 crisis in local governments in South East Europe, documented the challenges and collected a number of good practices on how to respond to the crisis and how to support our communities.</em></p>\r\n<p><em><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//CovidStudyDCG.JPG\" alt=\"CovidStudy\" width=\"400\"></em></p>\r\n<p><em>The Study has shown that COVID-19 has had major impact on all SEE local governments - 45% of them think that the impact from the crisis is strong or very strong, while 38% perceive a moderate – but still significant impact. COVID-19 has a strong territorial dimension - there are differences in the impact within and across local governments throughout SEE. Although a challenge everywhere, our study suggests that local Governments from Kosovo*, Albania, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Romania and Turkey seem to have experienced a stronger impact compared to the rest of SEE.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>At the COVID-19 outbreak, the lack of adequate financial resources was the most important challenge of SEE LGs. Currently, their key challenge is the reopening and revival of local communities and economies.”</em> – highlighted Mr. Manolov.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, Mr. Manolov stressed that:  “<em>The Study also confirmed that in such difficult times, SEE local governments not only coped with the crisis, providing the necessary prevention measures, supporting vulnerable groups and subsidising local economies, but many of them also took a brave step forward: using innovation and digitalisation to solve the problems caused by the pandemics.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>There are three important points from the Study I would like to highlight: The dramatic impact of the crisis on <strong>local finances</strong>, the need for intergovernmental policy consultation and coordination and the importance of <strong>cross-border cooperation i</strong>n coping with the crisis by searching for the best solutions.”</em></p>\r\n<p>The NALAS President concluded his opening address by acknowledging that over a decade KDZ Centre for Public Administration Research and their BACID Programme have played a very important role in strengthening governance structures in the region and in supporting NALAS promote decentralisation and the role of local government. The know-how transfer in the fields related to European Integration and modernisation of local public administration, facilitated by KDZ and BACID, have been highly appreciated by NALAS and its members.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, as part of the Conference program, a good practice of the Localizing and Measuring Sustainable Development Goals in Riga will be presented.</p>\r\n<p>In parallel, the Conference will further be enriched with sessions with local actors working towards implementing the Agenda 2030. Four sessions on different topics regarding SDGs and local governments will be addressed:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Governance and democracy</li>\r\n<li>Climate adaptation and Smart Cities</li>\r\n<li>Participation and civil society</li>\r\n<li>Local economic development </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//EltonStafa.JPG\" alt=\"Elton\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>NALAS Decentralisation and Public Finance Expert, Mr. Elton Stafa, presented at the Governance and democracy session, underlining that decentralisation is a process, not a goal. The goal is to improve the quality of life of citizens. Furthermore, Mr. Stafa added that Local governments can act as catalysts for improving the quality of services and creating more economic opportunities for citizens, but to do so, they must be supported with adequate financial resources. </p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//DarkoMrvaljevic.JPG\" alt=\"Darko\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Mr. Darko Mrvaljevic, NALAS Regional Expert on EU integration and EU funds, spoke at the session on Local economic development.

Burdened with unpaid care work women have less free time to be active in public life.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Therefore, the central governments need <strong>to adopt measures for balancing work and life responsibilities to allow for balanced women’s participation in local life, especially in the pandemic</strong> which institutionalized gendered roles and some historic inequalities became more vivid.</p>\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n<li>Gender equality is very often not considered highest priority on the political agenda of the local and central government, as the Covid-19 crises showed.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>This has to be amended by promotion of the <strong>importance of engendering of policy and budgets and enhancement of the awareness on the transformative power of GRB</strong> for our societies, and by including women and women’s organizations in the crises response.</p>\r\n<h2> </h2>\r\n<h2>RECOMMEND and INVITE PEER MAYORS</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Citizens, women and men, trust local governments if their policies and budgets deliver for both women and men. Therefore, the <strong>local policies need to be evidence based and budgets to respond to the needs of women and men</strong>. To do that the local governments must <strong>apply the GRB practices</strong> and <strong>employ mechanisms of citizens participation so that women can voice their needs</strong>.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>As women have less free time it is recommended to re-organize such events adapting the time and place of the meeting to the needs of women and to invite citizens personally; to offer child care during meetings; develop online platforms and social media for women to voice their needs; use knowledgeable and strong women as well as CSOs in mobilization of citizens in policy and budget making on local level.</p>\r\n<p>The pandemic showed that consultations are less used and this results with adopted measure which create gender gaps. Therefore, exploring possibilities for digitalizing consultation processes and making it available to all, including the most marginalized should be a priority in Covid-19 and post Covid-19 period.</p>\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n<li>Women are less active in local life than men. They take the bigger share of burden of work at home. They choose to be active in CSOs and often when they start a business, their business idea is around a resolution of a problem, often a community problem. Women tend to join activities undertaken by community leaders, not necessarily politicians.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>To increase women activity in local life</strong> it is recommended to the municipalities to support CSOs, to support local women businesses, to involve young girls through Erasmus projects; and support women networks. Consulting the CSOs and in particular women’s CSOs is a recommended avenue for increasing gender responsiveness of response measures to Covid-19.</p>\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n<li>Women and men use of public spaces differently. In order for women to be active in local life <strong>redefining public spaces in cities and villages is needed to be done along the philosophy</strong> that each of us uses space differently. Creating public spaces such as parks, benches, green areas, playgrounds; provides for women to feel safe, to use public spaces for which public resources have been spent, to move and have interactions with and within the community.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Especially in the pandemic, public spaces are important as people can socialize only outdoors respecting safe distance. This approach allows women to have equal access and use/control over the resources (goods and services) financed through the municipal budget.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<h2>RECOMMEND to NALAS</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>NALAS Knowledge Management System has an important role in increasing capacity on Gender Responsive Budgeting. Therefore, the network<strong> needs to enhance scope of the capacity development measures on GRB,</strong> particularly, generic training in gender responsive budgeting within NALAS members and generic training on gender impact assessments; to develop guidelines for gender analysis and checklists local governments can use when engendering policies and budgets; as well as to develop guidelines for social media use in citizens participation in policy making.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n<li>To strengthen a role in <strong>knowledge management on GRB</strong> in the region, by collecting best practices, developing case studies, developing data sets for gender performance indicators and work on impact assessment of gender budgeting (measures adopted and implemented on local level) as to determine influence they had on women and men, their status, and on equality between women and men, including influence on gender equality of the measures developed and implemented to tackle the Covid-19 health and economic crises.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n<li>Finally, in order to <strong>promote GRB and facilitate networking for GRB</strong> it is recommended that NALAS <strong>promotes the impact of gender budgeting on lives of people in SEE</strong> through personal interest stories, case study development, videos, GIFs and etc.; and organize community of practice on GRB in specific policy areas: local economic development, education, waste management, climate change, agriculture, social protection, crises management and etc.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Download the recommendations:</p>\r\n<p title=\"NALAS GRB recommendations 2021\"><a href=\"/Home/Download/NALAS_GRB_Rec\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> NALAS GRB recommendations 2021</a></p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-21ga48.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/NALAS_GRB_Rec"], "files": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/NALAS_GRB_Rec", "path": "NALAS_GRB_Rec", "checksum": "d68d0907ba8f912fc179c68192317026", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Home/Download/NALAS_GRB_Rec"}], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-21ga48.png", "path": "low-21ga48.png", "checksum": "34fd4febf6c4004a2961c60dac2acbd2", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-21ga48.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

The spirit of cooperation and cohesion that has been developed during the implementation of the Social Dialogue Forum often spreads beyond the Forum and helps in solving other community issues, they concluded.</p>\r\n<p title=\"sdf5\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//sdf5.png\" alt=\"sdf5\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The participants of the webinar actively engaged in exchanging their views, knowledge and experiences. <em>“I think that this excellently organised forum is very important for bringing closer local actors in creating functional partnerships and a constructive dialogue”</em>, said one of the participants. <em>“The fight against the prejudices that might exist among local actors might be one of the tasks for the future. Our state systems have functioned for years in a way that each system is a separate unit. That is why the dialogue is a challenge for the future, in a sense of improving its functionality for the benefit of citizens”</em>.</p>\r\n<p><em>“The key of all dialogues and agreements is horizontal and vertical connection of all participants in one process, mutual cooperation, trust and respect for the benefit of all citizens of the local community and contribution to achieving the long-term goals”</em>, rightly pointed out another participant, and there is no better conclusion to our today's topic.</p>\r\n<p>We thank our moderator, Ms. Nikica Kusinikova and all participants for the great exchange all and we hope you join us for our next webinar on 4 March 2021, on <a href=\"http://www.nalas.eu/Event/Details/web_MOT\">Mobile Outreach Teams</a>.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong>Materials from the webinar</strong> </p>\r\n<p title=\"Agenda SDF\"><a href=\"http://nalas.eu/Home/Download/Agenda_SDF\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> Agenda SDF</a></p>\r\n<p title=\"SDF Webinar Flyer\"><a href=\"http://nalas.eu/Home/Download/SDF_flyer\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> SDF Webinar Flyer</a></p>\r\n<p title=\"Social Dialogue Forum Concept - Krisitna Hadzi-Vasileva\"><a href=\"http://nalas.eu/Home/Download/SDF_Concept\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> Social Dialogue Forum Concept - Krisitna Hadzi-Vasileva</a></p>\r\n<p title=\"Forum for Social Dialogue in Tetovo N Macedonia RDDA SONCE - Nezir Huseini\"><a href=\"http://nalas.eu/Home/Download/SDF_Sonce\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> Forum for Social Dialogue in Tetovo N Macedonia RDDA SONCE - Nezir Huseini</a></p>\r\n<p title=\"Albanian Center for Integration of People with Special Needs, Elbasan - Artan Spahiu\"><a href=\"http://nalas.eu/Home/Download/SDF_Elbasan\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> Albanian Center for Integration of People with Special Needs, Elbasan - Artan Spahiu</a></p>\r\n<p title=\"Albanian Center for Integration of People with Special Needs, Elbasan - Artan Spahiu\"> </p>\r\n<p><strong>Video recording</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/XFhHwkU8vcY\" width=\"425\" height=\"350\"></iframe></strong></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><em>This webinar is activity of the NALAS project “Enhancing local capacities to implement the 2030 Agenda and the Leave No One Behind Principle”, implemented by the associations of local authorities from the Western Balkans in cooperation with and supported by the regional project on “Social Rights for Vulnerable Groups”.

The participants had the chance to learn about and practice various online tools that can support their work as trainers for online trainings, ensuring relevant, interesting and engaging training formats. </p>\r\n<p><em>“It is completely irrelevant whether people work together in analogue or on the basis of digital instruments: What matters is whether they work together”,</em> summarises the trainer Mr. Stefan Friedrichs.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Online_4\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Online_4.png\" alt=\"Online_4\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><em>“In the ocean of online trainings around us, only a few stand out – those that are not only relevant, but also keep participants’ attention and retain their energy high until the end”</em>, says Ms. Jelena Janevska, RCDN Knowledge Manager from NALAS, the organiser of this training. “<em>I am now confident that the trainers from our Pool will now deliver quality and interesting trainings for the benefit of the end users-the municipalities and public utility companies in our Region”, </em>adds Mr. Miodrag Kolic, RCDN Quality Manager from NALAS.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Online_3\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//Online_3.png\" alt=\"Online_3\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>RCDN aims to increase effectiveness and efficiency of the water utilities in the Western Balkans, contributing to better service provision with larger numbers of population groups getting access to drinking water and sanitation services and meeting the European Union (EU) environmental <em>Acquis Communautaire. </em>To achieve this, RCDN has three key components: 1) Association Development, 2) Capacity Development Offer and Delivery and 3) Partnership and enabling Capacity Development Environment.</p>\r\n<p>RCDN works with LGAs and APUCs in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, while the final beneficiaries are the top and middle managers from municipal and regional utility companies and officers in charge in municipalities. The project is managed by GIZ, on behalf of SECO and BMZ, and is implemented by a Project Implementation Team consisted of IAWD, Aquasan and NALAS.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Online_4\"> </p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Online_2.png", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Online_4.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Online_3.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Online_2.png", "path": "low-Online_2.png", "checksum": "45558c3a09d4804f92d86ae14dc48f19", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-Online_2.png"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Online_4.png", "path": "Online_4.png", "checksum": "4f5ee973dcb833728e51385ebfac4765", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Online_4.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Online_3.png", "path": "Online_3.png", "checksum": "010d971410c04332e0d5ff7f6ad88d1f", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Online_3.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

It brought together over 500 registered participants and 55 speakers, in six events centred around local economic development, by leaving no one behind.</p>\r\n<p>During this General Assembly, Mr. Emanuil Manolov, Mayor of Pavlikeni, Bulgaria, successfully concluded his one-year mandate as a President of NALAS and this important role rotated to <strong>Mrs. Tatiana Badan</strong>, Mayor of Selemet Municipality in Moldova and President of the Congress of Local Authorities from Moldova (CALM). Mrs. Badan is the 13<sup>th</sup> NALAS President and the first female President in the history of the Network.</p>\r\n<p title=\"21ga49\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga49.png\" alt=\"21ga49\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Mrs. Badan is an inspiring woman. She has almost a three decades long experience in local public administration and serves as a Mayor for more than 18 years, in five mandates. Her municipality, Selemet, is the biggest village from Cimișlia District with a population of 4,000. Mrs. Badan is proud of all the improvements she has led in her locality, some of which are the social centre for disabled and vulnerable children, kindergarten, general and music school, local museum, regional market for local producers, various infrastructure investments, etc. For her achievements in 2014 Mrs. Badan was awarded “Mayor of the Year”.</p>\r\n<p>Mrs. Badan is President of CALM since its creation in 2010. Also, Mrs. Badan is very active internationally. From 2016 to 2020 she was the Head of the Moldovan Delegation to the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe.</p>\r\n<p>Mrs. Badan is a consistent promoter of gender equality and of the idea that women must participate in the governance structures at all levels and she advocates for the most active and fair involvement of women in the decision-making processes.</p>\r\n<p title=\"MrsBadan1\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//MrsBadan1.jpg\" alt=\"MrsBadan1\" width=\"399\" height=\"299\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>JJ: Mayor Badan, congratulations for the new role you just assumed, President of NALAS. Since you have been a Vice-President of the Network and a Delegate in its General Assembly on behalf of CALM, you are quite familiar with NALAS’ work. What does NALAS mean to you personally, as a Mayor?</strong></p>\r\n<p>NALAS is a very important partner for the Congress of Local Authorities from Moldova. Above all it is a platform of the people united not only by common professional environment, but a platform of the people united by common goals and aspirations – in terms of advocacy, in terms of reforms, in terms of exchange of practices and consolidation of capacities as well as in terms of European and global integration. For me as well as for many of my colleagues, NALAS was the fundamental and the very first school of introduction into the basis of local autonomy and local democracy. The feeling of unification and of being not alone, but supported by the colleagues and friends from different countries was helping us a lot during hard times for local democracy and local autonomy in Moldova.  NALAS played a rather important role in creation and consolidation of CALM since its inception. Many NALAS members in their turn have contributed significantly to CALM initiation and development – National Association of Municipalities in Republic of Bulgaria, Association of Romanian Communes, Standing Conference of Towns and Municipalities from Serbia. CALM itself can be considered as an important success story of NALAS via its contribution to CALM institutional development, consolidation of CALM capacities and support for CALM members and secretariat. </p>\r\n<p title=\"Pres.Badan\"><strong><em>Download the full interview:</em></strong> </p>\r\n<p title=\"Interview with the 13th NALAS President Mayor Tatiana Badan\"><a href=\"/Home/Download/Interview_Pres_Badan\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> Interview with the 13th NALAS President Mayor Tatiana Badan</a></p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-MrsBadan.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga49.png", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//MrsBadan1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/Interview_Pres_Badan"], "files": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/Interview_Pres_Badan", "path": "Interview_Pres_Badan", "checksum": "89fe18f2ad4c2ca42a3e0d35e34b7a13", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Home/Download/Interview_Pres_Badan"}], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-MrsBadan.jpg", "path": "low-MrsBadan.jpg", "checksum": "4e9aaa6fdabbd52822e9de973e3007b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-MrsBadan.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga49.png", "path": "21ga49.png", "checksum": "351a430289c3601d7e9c0f53d6bbd809", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//21ga49.png"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//MrsBadan1.jpg", "path": "MrsBadan1.jpg", "checksum": "54482f5b0b7e52f35e613e6224bb72a1", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//MrsBadan1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

The webinar was hosted by the Association of Municipalities and Towns in the Republic of Srpska and the Association of Municipalities and Cities in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>\r\n<p title=\"mot12\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//mot12.png\" alt=\"mot12\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The mobile and outreach services have a huge importance, providing support to vulnerable population and hard to reach community groups and ensuring that no one is left behind. However, they are mainly provided by the civil society sector, without systematic approach, involvement of all relevant stakeholders and secure funding to ensure sustainability. Acknowledging and supporting the pioneer steps to institutionalise mobile and outreach services in the region, we all have to do more – these were some of the conclusions of the panellists and participants of the webinar, moderated by Ms. Nikica Kusinikova.  </p>\r\n<p>The Social Services Expert, Ms. Aleksandra Georgievska presented the concept of mobile and outreach services, the scope, benefits and steps in the provision of these services, from the preparation phase, up to monitoring and evaluation of the results. Ms. Georgievsska explained that mobile and outreach teams serve a wide range of citizens such as poor families in particular children and youth, people with mental health issues, persons with disabilities, street children, children in crisis, foster families, elderly people etc.  <em>“Considering the importance of mobile and outreach services and the support they provide to the ones left behind, filling in the gaps of the state services, the local level must engage more”</em>, concluded Ms. Georgievska.</p>\r\n<p title=\"mot17\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//mot17.jpg\" alt=\"mot17\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>For the municipality, mobile and outreach teams support building trust, bring vulnerable groups “on board” and provide long-term solution to social inclusion, alleviating poverty and reducing inequalities.  </p>\r\n<p>Mr. Dragan Jokovic from the Citizens Association for the promotion of Roma education “Otaharin”, from Bijelina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, presented their experience with mobile intervention teams, positively affecting lives of Roma children and their families.</p>\r\n<p title=\"mot15\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//mot15.png\" alt=\"mot15\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Ms. Daniela Gjorgievska from the Defence for Children’s Rights Association, operating in Shuto Orizari community in Skopje, North Macedonia, elaborated their experience in mobile and outreach services for children and families at risk during COVID-19.</p>\r\n<p title=\"mot14\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//mot14.png\" alt=\"mot14\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Participants again had a very active role during the webinar, sharing not only their questions and ideas, but also their good practices. Representatives from the municipality of Stara Pazova in Srbija shared their experience in supporting elderly and people with disability through mobile teams, as a result of which in 2009 the municipality established a home support service. Municipality of Smederevska Palanka shared their experiences in mobile teams for inclusion of Roma, as well as the coordinator for Roma issues in the city administration.</p>\r\n<p><em>“We shall not forget that one of the tasks of the mobile teams is the development of a social network.

The webinar brought together some 120 participants, who had the chance to learn and exchange on the basic principles and key characteristics of day-care services as a tool for provision of social services to vulnerable groups and the role of local governments in planning and provision of day-care services.</p>\r\n<p>Ms. Aleksandra Georgievska, social services expert, provided a comprehensive overview on what day-care centres are, the services they provide, the standards they use in service provision and the key stakeholders involved for a success.

And we know that to achieve this we need to build Europe at home. Our dream is to create European villages and cities here in Moldova and I have made a strong commitment during the presidential campaign to help local public administration achieve this objective”</em>.</p>\r\n<p>President Sandu suggested that this could be done by equitable access to public funding to all communities and fiscal decentralisation, and here, the role of CALM is crucial. <em>“Few weeks ago, the Moldovan Presidency and CALM signed an Agreement of cooperation. We also support the signing of a Roadmap for the implementation of the Committee of Regions’ recommendations“</em>. </p>\r\n<p title=\"21ga20\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga20.png\" alt=\"21ga20\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><em>“I would like to also express my appreciation for NALAS. NALAS is a strong partner for our local authorities, having also a strong contribution in the creation and strengthening of CALM. We are grateful for NALAS expertise and guidance, which has been contributing to enhancing the capacity of our local authorities to grow stronger and more independent”</em>, said President. Sandu.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ms. Tatiana Badan</strong>, CALM President, Mayor of Selemet, Moldova stressed that these difficult times more than ever emphasise the role of local governments and the importance of NALAS. <em>“Local governments are on the forefront in responding to this crisis, but they are also the first ones that respond to citizens’ everyday needs, be it social, economic or environmental. The challenges of local governments need to be listened to and understood, and they must be supported to address these challenges in the most effective and efficient manner”</em>, appealed Ms. Badan.</p>\r\n<p title=\"21ga12\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga12.png\" alt=\"21ga12\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Further on, Ms. Badan focused on three key priorities: 1) Decentralisation and local democracy; Role of local public authorities in stabilising democratic processes, development and combating crises; and Role of Local Government Associations and NALAS as their network in strengthening local governments and voicing their interests.</p>\r\n<p><em>“Centralised response to crisis is an outdated concept that does not materialise where it is mostly needed – in the communities, where life happens. Instead of centralisation, we call for effective intergovernmental policy consultation and coordination and direct access to funds for local authorities. There is a need for a real, effective and mutually respectful partnership between central and local authorities. Therefore,</em> <em>real decentralisation and local democracy must be recognised as essential and priority values, approaches in the process of accession to the European Union and in EU programs, by all key actors, including national governments and European Union institutions”</em>, said Ms. Badan.</p>\r\n<p><em>“We believe that national associations of local authorities, but also NALAS, should be considered as strategic partners in the processes of economic recovery and reform, both for central governments and for the European Union</em>”, concluded Ms. Badan.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mr</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> Ion Ceban</strong>, Mayor of Chisinau, Moldova, CALM Vice-President, Head of Moldovan Delegation to the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe, emphasised that without local development we cannot talk about national development. <em>“I would like to highlight the work of mayors and local elected representatives for their steady support to one another, to the principles and ideals of local self-government during this unprecedented time we are experiencing”, </em>said Mr. Ceban.</p>\r\n<p title=\"21ga14\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga14.png\" alt=\"21ga14\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>At this General Assembly, <strong>Mr. Emanuil Manolov</strong>, NALAS President, Mayor of Pavlikeni, Bulgaria, rounded up an important year as NALAS President. <em>“Leading NALAS in such difficult times was a big responsibility, but as Ms. Badan noted, it was an opportunity to strengthen our leadership as a representative organisation of local authorities in the region. I believe that NALAS managed to meet the expectations of its members and thanks to the efforts of each one of you, we adapted to the changes and transform our way of work, thus achieving even better results for the local self-government at the day”</em>, said Mr. Manolov.</p>\r\n<p title=\"21ga15\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga15.png\" alt=\"21ga15\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The keynote addresses, focused on <strong>Local Democracy and European Integration in South and Eastern Europe</strong>, were delivered by:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Leendert Verbeek, President of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe;</li>\r\n<li>Majlinda Bregu, Secretary General, Regional Cooperation Council;</li>\r\n<li>HE Sybille Suter Tejada, Ambassador of Switzerland in North Macedonia;</li>\r\n<li>Maciej Popowski, Director General, Directorate General Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations (DG NEAR); and</li>\r\n<li>Mr Nikola Dobroslavić, Prefect of the Dubrovnik-Neretva County, rapporteur for the European Committee of the Regions (CoR) opinion on 2020 Enlargement Package.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The distinguished speakers talked about the post COVID-19 recovery, the importance of investing in public administration reform for the benefit of the citizens of the Region, and the crucial role of local self-governments and their national and regional associations.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>“</em></strong><em>Crises will continue affecting our communities in such ways where democracy, constitutional values and civil and human rights are at stake”</em>, said <strong>Mr. Leendert Verbeek</strong>, President of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe. <em>“The coronavirus pandemic has tested both the policies implemented in our respective countries and our democratic systems themselves. It has aggravated the so-called recurring issues in the application of the European Charter on of Local Self-Government. And this include the lack of consultation, inadequate distribution of competences and financial resources and excessive supervision repeatedly pinpointed by the Congress over the past years. Although we noted many good practices at all levels of governance, we have also observed the tendency to recentralised, which became especially evident during this crisis”, </em>warned Mr. Verbeek.</p>\r\n<p title=\"21ga13\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga13.png\" alt=\"21ga13\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Mr. Verbeek also emphasised that Congress' priorities in the upcoming years will focus on creating resilient, democratic, cohesive, sustainable and digital societies and he sees NALAS strategic plan fully aligned.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ms. Majlinda Bregu</strong>, Secretary General of the Regional Cooperation Council (RCC), spoke about the importance of public administration reform throughout the Region, for the benefit of its citizens. <em>“We know that there is a lot of work ahead of us and we can do it only jointly. You find in RCC a reliable partner working hard for the Western Balkans and inviting local governments to have an active role in implementation of the common market and green agenda”</em>, said Ms. Bregu.</p>\r\n<p title=\"21ga16\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga16.png\" alt=\"21ga16\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><em>“I extend my praises to all the Mayors and local government staff who have been on the forefront in responding to the COVID-19 crisis, ensuring that their citizens, especially the most vulnerable ones, are taken care of”</em>, said <strong>HE Sybille Suter Tejada</strong>, Ambassador of Switzerland in North Macedonia.</p>\r\n<p title=\"21ga17\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga17.png\" alt=\"21ga17\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>Mr. Nikola Dobroslavić</strong>, Prefect of the Dubrovnik-Neretva County and Rapporteur for the European Committee of the Regions (CoR) opinion on 2020 Enlargement Package stated that the opinion emphasises the challenges of democracy in the Western Balkans, especially at local level. The key pitfalls notified there are the state capture, usurpation of the governance by the ruling parties, shortcomings in rule of law, freedom of media, gender equality and organised crime. </p>\r\n<p title=\"21g19\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga19.png\" alt=\"21g19\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><em>“Collaboration and partnerships are important for positive economic and social development in normal times, but during crisis of a current scale they become essential. NALAS is for me a symbol for collaboration and partnership”</em>, said <strong>Mr. Maciej Popowski</strong>, Director General, Directorate General Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations (DG NEAR).</p>\r\n<p title=\"21ga18\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga18.png\" alt=\"21ga18\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><em>“Such an association of many local authorities that NALAS represents will help strengthen the voice and will help finding positive solutions to recover and emerge from this crisis. European Union has launched an ambitious economic and investment plan for the Western Balkans and local authorities will have a key role to make it a success. The strength of NALAS is in my view that it transcends the boundaries between inside and outside of the European Union. NALAS represents local government associations from both within the EU and the neighbours. This allows you to support each other and exchange experience in a unique way”, </em>stated Mr. Popowski. <em>     </em>  </p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #003366;\"><strong><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/CnvubDk27gg\" width=\"425\" height=\"350\"></iframe></strong></span></p>\r\n<p>During the Statutory Session, NALAS commemorated a special person, <strong>Mr. Mico Micic, </strong>Mayor of the City of Bijeljina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, NALAS General Assembly Delegate and a former NALAS President.

The recent negative trends of political shaping of the reforms, recentralisation and control of local government must stop and be replaced with a dialogue, institutional communication and coordination of different governance levels and building trust. Capacities of local governments and their Associations shall be strengthened further and relevant data shall be collected and used for evidenced policy-making.  </p>\r\n<p><em>“Local Governments in Georgia, Ukraina and Moldova have an important role in service delivery, education and social protection, but very limited financial autonomy.

Looking to find out more about the quantity of waste generated and where it ends? NALAS' latest, 2019 report \"Benchmarking on Solid Waste Management in South-East Europe\" might have the answers.</p>\r\n<p>The report is a joint effort of the NALAS Task Force on Solid Waste and Water Management. It provides a comparative picture of the state of waste management sector both at the national and local level in countries of South-East Europe. Secondly, as the third in a series of benchmarking reports this document aims to follow the trends in waste management practice in countries of the region and monitor progress towards meeting EU standards in this field. Furthermore, the Report can provide LGAs material and arguments for policymaking but also ideas and inputs for future development projects or programs.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, this document has an awareness-raising purpose in terms of promoting and communicating new trends and policies in waste management and related topics introduced by the EU. In this particular case the topic of Circular Economy was introduced by extending the methodological approach with two additional indicators, one local and one national, and the survey about the basic concept and Circular Economy principles among NALAS SWWM Task Force members.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Download the report:</p>\r\n<p title=\"Benchmarking Report on Solid Waste Management in South-East

Local and regional governments played an important role in influencing the definition of the SDGs, successfully campaigning for a stand-alone goal on Sustainable Cities and Human Settlements (SDG 11), and for international recognition of the pivotal role of local and regional government in sustainable development.</p>\r\n<p>As the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda must be achieved at global, national and subnational levels, the success of this ambitious agenda is dependent on the active involvement of every level of government and of a large variety of stakeholders. The framework of the SDGs with its universal definition of goals and targets has to be adapted to concrete situations and specific needs to create actual benefits for concrete people and their living conditions. This process of taking into account subnational contexts in the achievement of the 2030 Agenda, is what we understand by “Localising the SDGs”.</p>\r\n<p>Localisation relates both to how the SDGs can provide a framework for local development policy and to how local and regional governments can support the achievement of the SDGs through action from the bottom up. In this respect the capacities of municipal structures to implement the 2030 Agenda and monitor the achievement of SDGs on local level and the involvement of public, private and civil society actors are crucial.</p>\r\n<p>This Handbook has been designed to serve exactly this purpose. To help practitioners at municipal level in improving their knowledge and strengthening their understanding of the relevance of the 2030 agenda and the SDGs at local level, to raise their capacities to become promoters of the SDGs and to be able to sensitise other stakeholders.</p>\r\n<p>The Handbook provides the key information about the SDGs, explains the role of municipalities in their implementation and explores awareness raising tools that municipalities could use to bring SDGs closer to their citizens. The Handbook also provides for a variety of examples from the region and beyond that illustrate what municipalities have done to promote SDGs and how this affected their wellbeing.</p>\r\n<p>The Handbook also provides an advice on integrating SDGs in local strategies and explores the role that LGAs and NALAS play in mobilising municipalities to achieve SDGs.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Download the Handbook:</p>\r\n<p title=\"Agenda 2030 in my municipality\"><a href=\"/Home/Download/SDGs_Handbook\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> Agenda 2030 in my municipality</a></p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SDGs_Hand.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/SDGs_Handbook"], "files": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/SDGs_Handbook", "path": "SDGs_Handbook", "checksum": "2e1ef358534c2a181b5ea80ef66277b5", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Home/Download/SDGs_Handbook"}], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SDGs_Hand.jpg", "path": "low-SDGs_Hand.jpg", "checksum": "d79fd83f24ba89eddae428ef8b4ef23c", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SDGs_Hand.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

In the same time, local governments play an important role in making the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) a reality.</p>\r\n<p><em>“Two thirds of the SDGs cannot be achieved without local governments. Austria holds the 7<sup>th</sup> place in implementing SDGs globally. Still, our main challenges remain SDGs 9, 11, 13 and 17. Sustainable development is a process where permanent efforts are needed.

Recovery efforts must have strong social dimension. We have the opportunity to do more than mitigating the crisis and invest in sustainable future”</em>, said Mayor Dimov.</p>\r\n<p>He explained that Dimitovgrad is one of the pioneers of medical innovation, via intelligent medicine, providing remote diagnosis for vulnerable groups, especially elderly people.</p>\r\n<p title=\"21ga43\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga43.png\" alt=\"21ga43\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>“Local governments as drivers of local economic development” was the focus of the address by <strong>Mr. Nikolae Dandis</strong>, Mayor of Cahul, Moldova and CALM Vice President. <em>“To transform remittances into development, the focus of Cahul goes to attracting investors from diaspora, supporting them in identifying best opportunities for investment and implementing them swiftly”</em>, said Mr. Dandis.</p>\r\n<p title=\"21ga44\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga44.png\" alt=\"21ga44\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>Mr. Džemal Lekić</strong>, Director of the Information System Center of the City of Podgorica, Montenegro, focused on the Smart City Agenda and elaborated why Podgorica is one of the pioneers in digitalisation of local public services in the Region. <em>“Digitalisation requires continuous improvement and modernisation. Podgorica started with digitalising the key local public services to citizens and as a next step also introduced digitalisation in culture”</em>, said Mr. Lekić.</p>\r\n<p title=\"21ga45\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga45.png\" alt=\"21ga45\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>Mr. Michael Samec</strong>, Project Leader, GIZ, spoke about the social dimension of sustainability, highlighting that access to social, economic and cultural rights should be equal and offered to everyone, leaving no one behind. <em>“We work a lot on social mapping, as we see relevant data crucial for targeted and socially sensitive policy planning and decision making. Leaving no one behind requires that you know who are the people and groups that are likely to be left behind”</em>, said Mr. Samec.</p>\r\n<p title=\"21ga46\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga46.png\" alt=\"21ga46\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>“EU and local government sustainable development in the post COVID-19” was the topic addressed by <strong>Ms. Amandine Sabourin</strong>, Policy and Advocacy Officer of CEMR/PLATFORMA. Ms. Sabourin brought closer the opportunities for local governments in the EU programmes Think Europe and the Global Europe instrument. <em>“There are three key issues that the EU will have to address via its programs: 1. The role of local governments as policy makers and key service providers; 2. The necessary support to decentralised cooperation and exchange among cities; and 3. The need to strengthen Local Government Associations</em>”, emphasised Ms. Sabourin.</p>\r\n<p title=\"21ga47\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga47.png\" alt=\"21ga47\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Participants actively engaged in the panel discussion, addressing relevant questions related to the organisational changes needed to introduce digitalisation of local services, how the pandemic has impacted the Smart City Agenda, how can social inclusion and sustainability become a key component of decentralisation reforms and improving intergovernmental coordination, what should be a priority for a municipality with limited resources: to invest in boosting economic activities or in social inclusion, and much more.</p>\r\n<p title=\"21ga64\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga64.png\" alt=\"21ga64\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #003366;\"><strong>Second Forum of Women Mayors of South-East Europe: Inclusive Local Economic Development</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>The Second Forum of Women Mayors in South-East Europe was oganised with support of UN Women and focused on inclusive local economic development.</p>\r\n<p title=\"21ga48\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga48.png\" alt=\"21ga48\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>Ms. Tatyana Badan</strong>, NALAS President, President of CALM, and Mayor of Municipality of Selemet, Moldova opened the Forum. <em>“In the last year, women have been on the forefront tackling COVID-19 crisis, as health care workers, caregivers, home-makers. They acted as community organisers and awareness raising actors. The crisis has also highlighted the disproportionate burdens that women took over as the lockdowns accelerated and services stopped to be delivered. This put local governments in the centrality of the COVID-19 response. The NALAS survey: South East European Local Governments in Post COVID-19 Socio Economic Recovery to this end shows that almost 60% of the municipalities have considered the gender specific needs and changes of women when designing and implementing COVID-19 response measures. The local authorities have provided support for women as a vulnerable group, and in particular prioritising single mothers at risk of poverty, up-scaling systems for preventing domestic violence and provision of essential services for survivors of violence, accompanied with awareness-raising campaigns. </em></p>\r\n<p title=\"21ga49\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga49.png\" alt=\"21ga49\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><em>Also, we the local governments from the SEE region have provided services for the elderly and feeble people, and supported the other most vulnerable single parents, mothers mainly. </em></p>\r\n<p><em>Hence, the world’s attention was also turned to gender analysis and assessment of impact of policies and measures developed in the crises on women and men and contributing on gender gap. Something I would encourage the NALAS members to do in the coming period, so lessons can drown and new more effective measures are developed to decrease the gender gap”</em>, said Ms. Badan.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ms. Ermira Lubani</strong>, a Program Specialist of the ECA Regional Office of UN Women, also addressed in the opening session. <em>“COVID-19 affects differently women and men and during this crisis existing gaps are widening. Women have been disproportionally affected by COVID-19, more likely losing their income and less likely accessing social protections measures. Specific measures need to be implemented to leave no one behind, such as using gender disaggregated data, gender analysis and consultations with relevant stakeholders”</em>, said Ms. Lubani.   </p>\r\n<p title=\"21ga50\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga50.png\" alt=\"21ga50\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The panel of Women Mayors on Local Economic Development to provide for inclusiveness:</p>\r\n<p>Challenges and solutions to gender equality, included valuable inputs by:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Natasha Petrovska, Mayor of Bitola, North Macedonia</li>\r\n<li>Larisa Voloh, Mayor of Palanca, Stefan Voda, Moldova</li>\r\n<li>Jasna Gabrič, Mayor of Trbovlje, Slovenia</li>\r\n<li>Mariana Gâju, Mayor of Cumpăna, Romania</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p title=\"21ga60\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga60.png\" alt=\"21ga60\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>Ms. Natasha Petrovska</strong>, Mayor of Bitola, North Macedonia presented the case of their start-up centre, that built local partnership among local government, university, NGOs and business community, resulting with 60 business ideas, 12 of which have been supported, 8 run by women.</p>\r\n<p title=\"21ga52\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga52.png\" alt=\"21ga52\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>Ms. Larisa Voloh</strong>, Mayor of Palanca, Stefan Voda, Moldova presented their Women’s Economic Empowerment Program, launched in 2018, which via bottom-up approach identified the needs, enhanced capacities of women and supported them start own businesses. <em>“As a result, this doubled the number of businesses run by women.

These two days are a great opportunity for us to reflect and formulate a clear message to be delivered in Poznan.

Ms.Dusanka Golubovic, Mayor of Sombor, Vice President of NALAS, in her opening remarks stated that <em>\"People often ask me how does it feel to be a woman mayor, and I always ask myself if that question carries within some unique dimension and is of utmost importance OR are we all equal and defined by our personal traits and characteristics, enthusiasm, responsibilities, and conscious, rather than by our gender?\"</em></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//SomborForum.JPG\" alt=\"Sombor\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Ms. Golubovic also stressed that: <em>“If there weren’t women fighting for women rights, women who were more determined in the past, we wouldn’t be here today and that’s why I think that we don’t have the right to underestimate our role, to the contrary we need to solidify it, so more women can undertake such actions.”</em></p>\r\n<p>Mr. Kelmend Zajazi, the NALAS Executive Director, Ms. Ermira Lubani, GRB Regional Advisor at UN Women, and Mr. Đorđe Staničić, Secretary General of the Standing Conference of Towns and Municipalities in Serbia also delivered their welcoming remarks at the opening ceremony.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//ForumGroup.JPG\" alt=\"Sombor\" width=\"400\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//Group2.JPG\" alt=\"Sombor\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The program of the Forum was rich with panel discussions and presentations that touched on the Status of gender equality in local life in SEE, Gender responsive budgeting – knowledge and skills in SEE, the European Charter for Equality of Women and Men role in Local Life, and why Women solidarity matters. A visit of the City of Sombor was also organized by the hosts.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//Group3.JPG\" alt=\"Sombor\" width=\"400\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//Gallery19.JPG\"

process of addressing gender inequality.”</em></p>\r\n<p>The two fruitful days of discussions and exchange resulted with fundamentals for developing conclusions and recommendations that appeal for an increased participation of women in politics, policy making and local life; creating an enabling environment for promotion of Gender Responsive Budgeting as a tool for reaching gender equal communities; and measuring impact of policies on women and men at local level.</p>\r\n<p><em>This Forum is part of NALAS project “Promoting e-learning and regional knowledge base development on gender-responsive budgeting”, supported in the framework of UN Women project “Promoting Gender Responsive Polices and Budgets: Towards Transparent, Inclusive and Accountable Governance in the Republic

This year’s conference focused on “Achieving resilience in water and wastewater utilities in the Danube region” brought together over 200 people coming from more than 25 countries representing all stakeholders of the water sector to discuss the way forward towards smart policies, strong utilities and sustainable services.</p>\r\n<p>Resiliency in water and wastewater utilities is becoming increasingly relevant globally and in the region in the context of inevitable climate change related shocks and the commitments made under the Sustainable Development Goals. The  opening keynote presentation was delivered by the CEO of the Global Water Partnership, Monika Weber-Fahr, outlining the reasons for why a resilient water sector is needed and why an integrated approach to water management is required to achieve the SDGs on water. This was followed by a panel discussion with representatives from the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River and of the Albanian Water Supply and Sewerage Association who provided their views on this topic from a water resources management and water and wastewater services perspective, respectively.</p>\r\n<p>Another key component of this year’s conference was the session on <strong>Sector performance for resilient services</strong>. In 2015, the World Bank, under the umbrella of the Danube Water Program undertook a comprehensive review of the water and wastewater services in 16 countries of the Danube region. These 16 countries represent a great diversity of socio-economic, development, and geographic realities, which share a joint resource, the Danube, an intertwined history; and a common trajectory toward European integration. This regional report has now been updated with the latest available data for each of the originally participating countries.</p>\r\n<p>The purpose of this session was to showcase the trends, progress and recommendations stemming from the updated review. The presentation included interactive participation from the audience using electronic tools. This was followed by case studies of utilities from the region that have participated in capacitybuilding activities under the Danube Learning Partnership (D-LeaP) and through that have achievedimprovements in their efficiency and service quality delivery.</p>\r\n<p>The session was closed with a panel discussion reflecting on the previous presentations among representatives from ministry, regulator, water utility association and a local governments association. In this panel, Boran Ivanovski, NALAS Programme Officer, presented the trends in fiscal decentralization through the NALAS Fiscal Decentralization Report indicators.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//DWPPanel.jpg\" alt=\"Panel Discussion \" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><em>“Increased fiscal autonomy of the local governments and ensuring reliable own sources of funding are key factors for better communal infrastructure investments, necessary for providing resilient services in the water sector. Also, Local Government borrowing should not be underestimated as a financial mechanism for long term capital infrastructure investments in the region of SEE”, shared Boran Ivanovski.  </em></p>\r\n<p>The Conference’s programme was further enriches with sessions on: Managing talent for resilient services, Cooperation as important tool to achieve resilient water and wastewater services, Evaluation and recast of EU water policies – status, challenges and lessons learned, How to achieve resilient wastewater treatment in the Danube region, Financing for resilient water infrastructure projects, and Water security.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Panel Discussion \"> </p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-DWPFamilyPhoto.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//DWPPanel.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-DWPFamilyPhoto.jpg", "path": "low-DWPFamilyPhoto.jpg", "checksum": "d3e6d43ec5cec33aed3c779c5f23666f", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-DWPFamilyPhoto.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//DWPPanel.jpg", "path": "DWPPanel.jpg", "checksum": "1eaedd035afcf3bd5de90f5e7abacf94", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//DWPPanel.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

In this context, the exchange with CEMR’s governance unit were highlighted to keep each other informed and updated on statements and recommendations brought to the attention of EU institutions.</p>\r\n<p>One of the major obstacles to enter into a constructive and fruitful exchange with the EU Commission on the important role local governments play in the region to adapt to EU acquis, to prepare for the provision of public services and to prepare the ground for a successful implementation of EU standards, lays within the one-sided dialogue the EU Commission maintains with central governments and line ministries. To face this challenge, both CEMR and NALAS need to joint forces in their advocacy and work together to convince the EU Commission to change their political speech and paradigm focussing on the central government level. Mr. Fras emphasised that only by exploiting to the fullest the genuine potential of the local level with its prospective to foster social cohesion, stability and peace, will help to bring about an EU closer to its future citizen.</p>\r\n<p>It is self-evident that CEMR and NALAS both play a crucial role to get local and regional governments interests and needs to be heard in Brussels and to strive for the recognition of LGAs to be considered as strategic dialogue partners by all EU institutions. The NALAS representatives, in line with CEMR statements on the Future of Europe, left no doubt about the fact that without towns, cities and regions being considered as strategic allies in building a more united, stronger and more democratic Union, fear is justified that the EU, including the present enlargement process, will not be able to mobilise the potential it needs to reinvent itself and to be the aspiration and vision for a life in peace, prosperity and stability so many hope for.</p>\r\n<p>Darko Fras and Kelmend Zajazi expressed NALAS’ determination and readiness to strengthen and enhance the existing cooperation and coordination with CEMR, both on policy and technical level, to specify concrete joint project proposals and advocacy activities in the frame of the actual enlargement process for the Western Balkans and the Eastern Neighbourhood Policy.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-cemr_ret.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-cemr_ret.png", "path": "low-cemr_ret.png", "checksum": "71e28c757e5fbf33d078157a4eac2d22", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-cemr_ret.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

This workshop is finalising the methodology for the RDO and is testing it among the 12 NALAS countries. The RDO is a powerful tool that measures the progress of decentralisation throughout South-East Europe, aiming to serve policy makers to develop better public policies that improve local democracy, local public services and citizens wellbeing.</p>\r\n<p>The workshop was opened by the Mayor of Skopje, President of ZELS and Vice-President of NALAS, Mr. Petre Shilegov, H.E.

It is certain that without actual, complete decentralization, there is no democracy, our cities and municipalities cannot develop and our citizens cannot have a better life. But it is also certain that the decentralization is not happening with the required pace. NALAS’ annual edition of the Fiscal Decentralization Report confirms this impression, using fiscal data from 12 countries of South-East Europe. This data must be an eye-opener for the politicians who create the fiscal policy of the countries. But, it won’t happen without us pushing for it. Thus, such data is a key argument for us, the local governments, and our Associations, to push the politicians to secure adequate funding for our competences”</em>, said Mr. Shilegov. <em>“I am happy that NALAS expands the success story of the Fiscal Decentralisation Report by including other areas to be measured by the Regional Decentralisation Observatory, such as the quality of services, as this is what citizens are interested about”</em>, concluded the Mayor of Skopje.</p>\r\n<p title=\"rdosk3\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//rdosk3.jpg\" alt=\"rdosk3\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><em>“For us, it is of great importance that Regional Decentralisation Observatory is setting-up benchmarks and serves to compare progress in different countries and support each other to go a step further in improving public services at local level.

Special attention was paid to Practitioner’s Navigator that will summarise and bring together all the project products in one concise electronic tool where the whole renovation process for energy efficiency in public buildings will be available for reference and use to municipal experts and decision makers.</p>\r\n<p>Central to the discussions was also the EmBuild Final Conference that will take place in Belgrade on the 7th June. EmBuild was designed to increase capacity of local level actors and develop simple tools that facilitate the formulation and implementation of local renovation plans. The final conference is a moment when the results of the project can be brought to the attention of a broader audience and trigger action beyond the focus of the 100 municipalities that are already involved in the project. The expected outcome of the final conference thus is: “How can municipalities be the engine for achieving the deep renovation target of Europe´s building stock”</p>\r\n<p>This will be achieved by showing best practices of local plans, highlighting aspects that may stimulate similar actions by others and presenting tools that can facilitate the formulation of local plans.</p>\r\n<p>EmBuild project receives funding from the Horizon 2020 European Union Research and Innovation Programme, More information about EmBuild project, its achievements and upcoming events are available at <a href=\"http://embuild.eu/\">http://embuild.eu/</a></p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-EmBuildSk.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-EmBuildSk.jpg", "path": "low-EmBuildSk.jpg", "checksum": "9016a4e2e26f1a85fde6ed77f36d1823", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-EmBuildSk.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

They can also have a windfall of other effects for our social, economic and personal lives. In this webinar, the discussion will focus on these other effects, also known as \"multiple benefits.\" Multiple benefits are too often overlooked when evaluating a renovation project as policymakers, owners and construction professionals alike have a difficult time quantifying them.</p>\r\n<p>The Horizon2020 project EmBuild is developing a novel approach to help assess the multiple benefits of public buildings renovation. The knowledge-based method eases the weighting and evaluating of benefits for public authorities, and it is particularly adapted to regional and local characteristics, needs and challenges.

To build capacities at local level was indicated as a crucial support. In this context, the elimination of the Local Administration Facility (LAF) is regrettable from the CoR point of view inviting the EU Commission to rethink it.</p>\r\n<p>Commissioner Hahn rated local and regional governments’ support as decisive when it comes to the implementation and the sustainability of EU acquis. It is a process where taking over the acquis is one thing, but more important is their implementation.</p>\r\n<p>He referred to the local governments as having an anchor role to play for stability by promoting socio-economic development and facilitating cross-border cooperation. Even though there is no EU acquis on the division of responsibilities between central and local level, and the Commission faces this fact as a difficulty when the issue comes up with external partners, the Commissioner expressed his conviction that strong local and regional governments can have positive impact on the countries’ development.</p>\r\n<p>The Commissioner values partnerships with local governments. Due to their direct relationship with the citizens local and regional governments have an important role to play regarding the protection of EU policy and its standards with much potential at hand. The case for a bottom-up approach as a useful direction was made by Commissioner Hahn in the context of the local and regional level’s contribution with knowledge on the ground.</p>\r\n<p>During the question-and-answer session with members of the political groups David Simmonds of the European Conservatives and Reformist Group clearly spoke in favour of a substantial role of Local Government Associations (LGAs) in the region. He called on the EU Commission for greater involvement of LGAs as a point of principle and a matter of political strategy to build good will and enthusiasm from the community upwards and considered this involvement as absolutely vital. Furthermore, participation of Associations through Macro-Regional Strategy would help generate Cross-Border-Cooperation.</p>\r\n<p>Right in this context, special rapporteur Franz Schausberger mentioned NALAS as a very important Association in the region and made the stance for local associations being involved in capacity building of local administrations so that they can be actively involved in the enlargement process.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>To see the video from the event, click <a href=\"http://web.ep.streamovations.be/new/index.php/event/stream/20180322-1430-special-committeeregions/embed?&amp;language=en&amp;autostart=true\">HERE</a>.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Joac_CoR_2.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Joac_CoR_2.jpg", "path": "low-Joac_CoR_2.jpg", "checksum": "74dc3a176873feecd2dccaaafbf8ee3e", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-Joac_CoR_2.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

The moderator of the rountable was Ms Natasha Ilijeva Acevska from the Network of Associations of Local Authorities (NALAS).  The session was organized around the following topics:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Current forms and results of central-local dialogue at national level;</li>\r\n<li>Benefits of evidence-based policy design in collaborative negotiations;</li>\r\n<li>Benefits of the regional peer learning in fiscal decentralization in SEE;</li>\r\n<li>Roles and contributions of the Ministries and Local Government Associations.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The stage was opened by Ms Brkić who presented the role of the Municipal Finance Department (MFD) and how they cooperate with the representatives of the three levels of sub-national governments in Croatia. She stressed the personalized approach they are promoting and using of phone calls and meetings in order to build mutual understanding in the process of the local budgeting, resolving the challenges of particular local governments etc. In parallel, the Croatian ministry performs monitoring of the fiscal decentralization in all competences and proposes solutions, even changes of the Law on Local Government Finances. She especially acknowledged the productive role of the Association of Cities of Croatia and almost daily interaction with them. Ms Brkic also discussed the cooperation with the citizens and pointed out to the portal <a href=\"https://savjetovanja.gov.hr/\">https://savjetovanja.gov.hr/</a> which is a platform through which the consultations for each legal document in Croatia are being carried out.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Sandeva made a review of the legal framework for municipal finances in Macedonia with an accent on the types of revenues received by the local governments and  on the example of the Budget Circular presented how the Ministry supports the municipalities in their budget preparations, by providing an estimate of the revenues, elaborating the strategic priorities of the Government, the parameters of distribution of the VAT revenues to the municipalities and the Government decisions on earmarked, block and other specific grants to the municipalities. The formal bodies established to support the central – local cooperation are: Committee for monitoring the development of the System for Financing the Municipalities, the Inter-ministerial Working Group on Decentralization and the cooperation with Association of Local Government Units (ZELS). The Macedonian case provoked discussion on the level of the public debt of the municipalities which is currently very low and the possibilities to increase the monitoring while liberating the criteria for municipal borrowing.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Radović presented the work of the Ministry and then her address showed an example of how a national ministry can utilize the municipal self- assessments performed by the local governments in Montenegro. She elaborated the process through which the Ministry picked up the discussions of a national forum on MFSA and working further on with the experts they developed a National Action Plan on MFSA that includes and analysis of the finances per the delegated competences to the Montenegrin local governments, and the fiscal impact it has produced both at local and central level. She also presented the case of the changes of the Law on Communal Services and the legislation of developments without building permits, examples of solutions with private – public partnerships, etc.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Haxhimali, as a representative of LGA – stressed the necessity of cooperation on all levels and forms: discussions, studies, joint projects etc. He illustrated the activities and challenges that Albania and therefore AAM too has been facing, regarding: the administrative and territorial reform from 2015 be followed by the discussions on the new law of LG financing which is still in drafting process. He stressed the benefits of evidence-based policy design in collaborative negotiations by using the example of the studies facilitated by AAM and provided by donors in Albania. He especially stressed the benefits of the regional peer learning in fiscal decentralization in SEE that took place in a form of comparative analysis and peer-learning event co-organised by AAM, NALAS, MoF Albania and USAID Albania. He said that the first steps in the drafting of the new Law was: observing, comparing and presenting data from LGAs in other SEE countries. He pointed the key element, roles and contributions of the Ministries and Local Government Associations for the central – local dialogue to be: proactive and active role, informing and consulting with members, and establishment of a consultative council-LG&amp;CG.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Runtic presented another interesting case from Croatia and the cooperation between the association and the ministries – a public municipal finance database that illustrates, describes and compares the local budgets of all municipalities in Croatia and all that by functions. For example, a citizen, mayor or central level administration can easily see the expenditures of the cities for education, health, kindergartens, etc (according to the FOCOG methodology of the UN) and compare them in time and between different cities, etc. This tool is a significant step towards increased transparency and accountability for the local funds by mayors, councilors and administration as the data for each city can be easily embedded on the websites of the cities, ngo-s, etc. The database is available at: <a href=\"http://www.udruga-gradova.hr/proracuni/\">http://www.udruga-gradova.hr/proracuni/</a></p>\r\n<p>Mr Marinkovic presented how the LGA can be a key agent in the capacity building of the local governments in implementation of new legal regulations, on the illustration of the role of the SCTM in the introduction of the Program Budgeting in Serbia. Namely, with the support of the EU, SCTM took over on itself the capacity building of all LGs in Serbia and organized a series of trainings and on-the-job mentoring by LGA experts, based on the Handbook for the Program Budgeting, thus establishing links between the strategic plans of the municipalities and their program budgets, mid-term planning, operational programs, expected results, indicators and resources. Herby, an important point was to make sure that an effective structure of the budgets is maintained, in line with the objectives of the users of the budget at local level.   Yet, he mentioned that one of the key success factors is the central – local coordination – the main delays in the implementation of the activity were due to the negligence of the budget calendar deadlines by the MoF and a Fiscal strategy which was adopted too late, as well as due to the lack of understanding and knowledge in many of the key actors.</p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-C2C_Bg.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-C2C_Bg.jpg", "path": "low-C2C_Bg.jpg", "checksum": "05f5ce9c2edc15dac2e94c3ee3cf2ad3", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-C2C_Bg.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

The conference explored the role of cities and municipalities in the economic development agenda, how it can be enhanced for the benefit of the citizens of South-East Europe and what are the best practices that cities can learn from.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//friedrichs.JPG\" alt=\"Stefan\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The event, organised by NALAS and the World Bank-Austria Urban Partnership Program, was one of the rare opportunities for local elected officials and local government practitioners of South-East Europe to look at the decentralisation from the wider development perspective and exchange practices and know how to improve public services. The event had the ambition to contribute to positioning the local governments as important drivers of growth in the regional cooperation agenda.</p>\r\n<p>On <strong>April 11</strong>, participants had a study visit in the City of Veles, hosted by the Mayor of Veles, Mr. Ace Kocovski. Mayor Ace Kocevski shared Veles’ commitment toward becoming a smart city through implementing “Veles Smart City – Strategy for development 2019 -2030”. </p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//Veles1.JPG\" alt=\"Veles \" width=\"400\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//Veles2.JPG\" alt=\"Panel\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>A panel discussion, led my moderator Mr. Stefan Friedrichs, with speakers representing local authorities, private sector and NGOs was organized within the premises of the Municipality  of Veles.

Mr. Wojciech Jerzy Tyciński, Ambassador of Poland in North Macedonia. </p>\r\n<p><em>“It has been a fascinating experience for all of us today to hear all the relevant exchange we had on the Berlin Process and its Regional Economic Area with different actors involved in the process. It became quite clear that it is not “IF” but “HOW” the local governments and their associations need to be involved in the process. I personally welcome the invitation of the Polish Ministry of Investment and Regional Development extended to NALAS in the frame of the Berlin process, to co-organise under its lead together with the Polish Association of Cities and the Polish Union of the Provinces the session on June 6th of the Forum of Cities and Regions, which is an important side event of the Western Balkan Policy Summit of Poznan 2019. This will be a platform of exchange regarding challenges and opportunities, we as local governments face in our region, in a direct dialogue with our Polish interlocutors. It will furthermore be an excellent opportunity to stress the potential contribution of the local government level in the Western Balkan countries to the Regional Economic Area and, we should all welcome this occasion in order to voice our recommendations to the EU and our government representatives regarding this ambitious initiative, which will generate new impulse to the EU enlargement process of the whole region from a local government perspective. I personally thank also the Mayor of Tirana, Mr Veliaj, and the representative of City of Ljubljana, Mr Babic, for their inspiring presentations. And of course, I thank all presenters, who contributed to the thematic workshops. We will process their recommendations and provide adequate follow up. I believe, we are today all inspired about the potentials in developing e-gov and smart city solutions, modernize sustainable urban mobility plans, include climate elements in our energy action plans and contribute by localising SDGs to the 2030 Agenda.\" </em>concluded Mr.Petre Shilegov, Mayor of Skopje, President of NALAS. </p>\r\n<p title=\"Snapshot\"> </p>\r\n<p title=\"final\"><img

Thus, the new strategy of NALAS focuses on smart cities, innovative solutions and inclusion”</em>, said Janevska.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Innov4\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Innov4.jpg\" alt=\"Innov4\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The first day of the 10<sup>th</sup> ReSPA Annual Conference set the stage for integrating innovation in public administration. The views of young people and special client groups was presented, the value of innovation in practice was be examined, various dimensions of innovation (social, technological, organisational) were discussed, and systems such as hackathon, were taken into consideration for creative problem solving. The participants also shared their views on the major innovation challenges in public administration.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Innov2\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Innov2.jpg\" alt=\"Innov2\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>During the second day, within the ReSPA Café, an open discussion on the structure, culture and personal change called for to promote innovation in public administration will be organised, and this discussion will be followed by a session dedicated to culture. Recognising, measuring and awarding innovation outcomes will be also explored. It is expected that the exchange of regional and international experiences in an open debate will bring benefits to all participants.</p>\r\n<p title=\"ReSPA 10th Annual Conference Agenda with Background Information \"><a href=\"/Home/Download/ReSPA_Agenda\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> ReSPA 10th Annual Conference Agenda with Background Information </a></p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Innov1.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Innov3.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Innov4.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Innov2.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/ReSPA_Agenda"], "files": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/ReSPA_Agenda", "path": "ReSPA_Agenda", "checksum": "7ac09f474a77804b0ddfdfd1f33e22c9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Home/Download/ReSPA_Agenda"}], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Innov1.jpg", "path": "low-Innov1.jpg", "checksum": "972376a8638aa64006dbb59791e0f258", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-Innov1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Innov3.jpg", "path": "Innov3.jpg", "checksum": "89ad5076f82e330f5a9f0e4e45f39619", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Innov3.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Innov4.jpg", "path": "Innov4.jpg", "checksum": "86ce1906fde3e5abab0635908a9c25da", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Innov4.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Innov2.jpg", "path": "Innov2.jpg", "checksum": "e98dd6412b7e12eea141558f9770be32", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Innov2.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

The solidarity principle should be nurtured and exercised at the local level. As citizens exercise solidarity to their neighbors, they learn on the benefits that it brings back to their community. This is the seed for growing liberal nations and strong EU”, </em>said Mr. Zajazi.</p>\r\n<p>The aim of this workshop was to encourage a lively debate that opens up the discussion, taking account of the views of different stakeholders on how to reconnect the European project to its citizens. A diverse group of 170 participants took part in the session, including local and regional representatives from across Europe, both technical level and politicians, European Commission officials, and consultants working on economic development issues, academics and researchers.</p>\r\n<p title=\"CEMR_17\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//CEMR_17.JPG\" alt=\"CEMR_17\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Speakers raised fundamental questions about the future of Europe, citizen participation and the role of local and regional governments. Today it is very fashionable to talk about cities and the local government level but it does not translate in any concrete recognition in EU decision-making process. Citizen participation is reflected at local level, but not necessarily further up.</p>\r\n<p>Right now there is a constitutional debate on the role of regions and cities in the European Parliament and the window of opportunity is open for cities and local governments to step in. It is about the future of the EU after BREXIT and the debate has already begun on the model of the EU in the future.</p>\r\n<p>A fundamental issue was raised on the recognition of LG and RG as crucial stakeholders in policy dialogue and EU programming. Although recognised in the European Consensus it does not translate in the EU Enlargement process.</p>\r\n<p>There was an unison consensus among most speakers that the bottom-up approach is the only feasible and sustainable way to build the EU on solid ground from the local government level upwards. Going local is indeed a challenge the EU institutions need to face in building a future Europe that remembers its roots and principles it was founded for: about people, for people and around people!</p>\r\n<p>The event was moderated by Frédéric Vallier, Secretary General of CEMR and Angelika Poth–Mögele, Executive Director of European Affairs, CEMR.</p>\r\n<p title=\"CEMR_2017_3\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//CEMR_2017_3.JPG\" alt=\"CEMR_2017_3\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p title=\"CEMR_2017_3\"> </p>\r\n<p title=\"CEMR_2017_2\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//CEMR_2017_2.JPG\" alt=\"CEMR_2017_2\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p title=\"Workshop Program \"><a href=\"/Home/Download/wshp_program\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> Workshop Program </a></p>\r\n<p title=\"CEMR_17\"> </p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-CEMR_17_5.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//CEMR_2017_6.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//CEMR_17.JPG", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//CEMR_2017_3.JPG", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//CEMR_2017_2.JPG", "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/wshp_program"], "files": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/wshp_program", "path": "wshp_program", "checksum": "b3239e47f6a58596983da32ac2b66c86", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Home/Download/wshp_program"}], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-CEMR_17_5.jpg", "path": "low-CEMR_17_5.jpg", "checksum": "3642fcc02edf2cb24d805ead46265400", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-CEMR_17_5.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//CEMR_2017_6.jpg", "path": "CEMR_2017_6.jpg", "checksum": "28724d3a95e0f355adb7c8685c9b91c4", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//CEMR_2017_6.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//CEMR_17.JPG", "path": "CEMR_17.JPG", "checksum": "19ae07be1dfd3ee92593cb199898ae5b", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//CEMR_17.JPG"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//CEMR_2017_3.JPG", "path": "CEMR_2017_3.JPG", "checksum": "0a87a6c415aadc0f95929726b4affc29", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//CEMR_2017_3.JPG"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//CEMR_2017_2.JPG", "path": "CEMR_2017_2.JPG", "checksum": "8e07cf0961431d85e1316f73e72407eb", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//CEMR_2017_2.JPG"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

Here we are today to learn from our recent experience and explore ways to improve coordination mechanisms at national and regional level. Any local community which is directly affected by a crisis should be rapidly supported horizontally and vertically. For that reason the Local Government Associations, Ministries and their networks need to timely design mechanisms and protocols to know how to act in these and similar emergency situations\"</em>, said in his opening speech Mayor Emil Draghici, President of NALAS.</p>\r\n<p title=\"marri2\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//marri2.jpg\" alt=\"marri2\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>\"Since the challenges of migration and migrants’ vulnerabilities are responded to at the local level, municipal authorities need to strengthen their capacities and establish mechanisms to prevent, prepare for, respond to and recover from the crises. Migration management policy disseminated from central authorities should consider the needs and capacities of local authorities\", said Ambassador Jovan Tegovski, representing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Macedonia. <em>\"Good governance requires partnerships between local and central authorities and all relevant stakeholders, including the civil society and private sector. Moreover, partnerships between local and central authorities can ensure that national policies align with the needs and capacities of local authorities at the heart of implementation. Local leadership and community actors can often play very important role in promoting positive perceptions toward migration and migrants.</em><em> Of particular relevance in this framework is the issue of migrant smuggling or facilitation of irregular entry, stay or transit which affects the safety and security of migrants and citizens alike. This is an issue which should also be addressed at local level\"</em>.</p>\r\n<p title=\"marri4\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//marri4.jpg\" alt=\"marri4\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Ms. Ulrike Lunacek, a Vice President of the European Parliament for the Western Balkans addressed the participants via video message. <em>\"We need a common asylum policy in the European Union\"</em>, said Ms. Lunacek. <em>\"Asylum seekers are human beings, not numbers. Money and resources need to go to local authorities fast. Local authorities have to provide them not just shelter, but also to convey the feeling of being safe and welcomed\"</em>.</p>\r\n<p title=\"marri3\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//marri3.jpg\" alt=\"marri3\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>In two panels, the Conference transferred knowledge and shared experiences among the affected countries in ensuring adequate role of local authorities in the current migrant crisis management.

The solid waste being generated increased for 100% and the municipality faced serious challenges in providing basic services. Under the leadership of the Mayor, the municipality succeeded to organise, coordinate with the central government and international donors and provide the basic services for the refugees passing this neighbouring municipality transiting from Greece.</p>\r\n<p title=\"marri6\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//marri6.jpg\" alt=\"marri6\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Mayor Mihalj Bimbo, from the Municipality of Kanjiza, at the border between Serbia and Hungary also demonstrated a real leadership from day one of the crisis. <em>\"We invested our own funds to provide safe transit of refugees and their human treatment, in the same time protecting the safety of our citizens and taking care of the environment\"</em>, said Mayor Bimbo.</p>\r\n<p>Mr. Robert Lacko, the President of the Municipal Council of Kanjiza focused on the things that need to be improved in the future. <em>\"Information exchange among border municipalities on expected flows has to exist and coordinated prevention activities must be undertaken\"</em>, said Mr. Lacko. <em>\"A training for the operational staff in local governments should be organised, to improve their preparedness for dealing with the situation\"</em>.</p>\r\n<p title=\"marri5\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//marri5.jpg\" alt=\"marri5\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Representing the Standing Conference of Towns and Municipalities in the Republic of Serbia, Ms. Aleksandra Vukmirovic focused on the role of local governments and local government associations in dealing with the crisis. \"In many situations, local governments were observers of what central government was doing, rather than active participants\", said Ms. Vukmirovic. Thus, series of measures need to be implemented to improve the situation, such as jointly plan the funds for dealing with the refugee and migration crisis, both from national resources, as well as the EU funds. Also, a regional mechanism should exist to connect all local, regional and national governments in South-East Europe in dealing with the crisis, as well as to facilitate good practices exchange.</p>\r\n<p>Mr. Bernhard Muller, the General Secretary of the Urban Forum and Former Mayor of Wiener Neustadt presented the Austrian experiences. \"60% of the municipalities in Austria did not accept any asylum seekers, therefore, for the first time in history the Parliament brought a Law on suitable distribution of asylum seekers in Austrian municipalities\", said Mr. Muller. \"In Austria, the local level is the most important in migration management\", concluded Mr. Muller.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"There is no direct funding available from the EU for local governments, all funding has to go via national governments, thus good cooperation with the central level is essential\"</em>, said Mr. Carlos Mascarel from the Council of European Municipalities and Regions. <em>\"Also, local governments from different SEE and EU countries should come together and cooperate on cross-national projects to improve the situation\".</em></p>\r\n<p title=\"marri8\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//marri8.jpg\" alt=\"marri8\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The donor community also took part in the Conference.

The workshop will provide Albanian national and local government officials with in-depth comparative knowledge about how key municipal finance issues are regulated in other countries, as well as with information about what solutions seems to have worked best.

Municipal Urban Planners and Finance Managers jointly discussed improving environment in land management and taxation.</p>\r\n<p>The link between municipal land management, land ownership and taxation was selected as a top priority topic during the last Urban Planning Task Force meeting. Further on, the trends of the NALAS Quick Response service in the first half of 2015 have indicated that property taxation became one of the burning issues for most of the countries in the region. Therefore, in consultation with the member LGAs' leadership and the relevant Task Forces, this topic was addressed at the Second NALAS Summer School on Local Governance and Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations, held in August 2015.</p>\r\n<p>The workshop of the Urban Planning Task Force and the Fiscal Decentralization Task Force continued to explore the links between property taxation and urban development. According to the group, the key urban development challenges are: empty/unused property, financing infrastructure for development, illegal construction, urban sprawl, energy/resource efficiency, stimulating economic development, maintenance of housing stock, use of city services by citizens from rural areas, gentrification and green space.</p>\r\n<p title=\"UP-FD1\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//UP-FD1.jpg\" alt=\"UP-FD1\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>With sometimes colliding starting points, in a vivid discussion, urban planners and finance managers agreed that the most important thing is to develop smart and sustainable urban plans, and implement them consistently, while due to the limited own resources of the local governments the resources from the local and shared taxes should be used to enable smart urban development.</p>\r\n<p title=\"UP-FD2\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//UP-FD2.jpg\" alt=\"UP-FD2\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p title=\"UP-FD3\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//UP-FD3.jpg\" alt=\"UP-FD3\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p title=\"UPTF4\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//UPTF4.jpg\" alt=\"UPTF4\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Thanks to the member of the Urban Planning Task Force representing the Standing Conference of Towns and Municipalities of Serbia, Ms. Klara Danilovic, participants had the opportunity to take part in a study-tour \"Urban Development Challenges in Belgrade\". Ms. Zaklina Gligorijevic, a Planner in the Strategic Planning Department of the Belgrade Urbanism Institute, Vice-President of the Belgrade Association of Architects and an activist, through a walk in both the old and the new City of Belgrade presented its main urban developments. Participants visited the 14 hectares land in the new part of the city, where the new railway and bus stations will be built, as well as the riverbank in the old city where Belgrade Waterfront Project is expected to change City's scenery.</p>\r\n<p title=\"UP-FD-5\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//UP-FD-5.jpg\" alt=\"UP-FD-5\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>We asked Ms. Gligirijevic what makes her the proudest about Belgrade's urban development. She smiled gently and said: <em>\"I might have a slightly different view on this question, but that is probably because I'm a professional. In my opinion, the most important thing about Belgrade's urban development is the effort to pay attention to the public things in the City, those that belong to all citizens, such as streets, river banks, pedestrian areas, parks, as well as all the supporting transportation infrastructure that will ease City's current bottlenecks. Everything else is market\". </em></p>\r\n<p title=\"UP-FD-TF-4\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//UP-FD-4.jpg\" alt=\"UP-FD-TF-4\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p title=\"UP-FD-6\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//UP-FD-6.jpg\" alt=\"UP-FD-6\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><em><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The external international expertise for the workshop has been funded by the Austrian Development Agency (ADA) through the BACID grant scheme (Building Administrative Capacities in Danube Region &amp; Western Balkans), managed by the Austrian Association of Cities and Towns (AACT) and KDZ Center for Public Administration Research.</span></em></p>\r\n<p title=\"UP-FD-TF-4\"><em> </em></p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-UPFDTF.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//UP-FD1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//UP-FD2.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//UP-FD3.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//UPTF4.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//UP-FD-5.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//UP-FD-4.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//UP-FD-6.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-UPFDTF.jpg", "path": "low-UPFDTF.jpg", "checksum": "572b23086a6e15841d408c10a974274f", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-UPFDTF.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//UP-FD1.jpg", "path": "UP-FD1.jpg", "checksum": "ade2e750c4b9556298e99ad2621f6375", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//UP-FD1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//UP-FD2.jpg", "path": "UP-FD2.jpg", "checksum": "cc6fbea48f28a7015cec614dc10a26ac", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//UP-FD2.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//UP-FD3.jpg", "path": "UP-FD3.jpg", "checksum": "a907e070b8e3703b3e9b30d120c2aada", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//UP-FD3.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//UPTF4.jpg", "path": "UPTF4.jpg", "checksum": "d0c852a0e2ab3eb670f6a10786493a31", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//UPTF4.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//UP-FD-5.jpg", "path": "UP-FD-5.jpg", "checksum": "8ab002daea247315a8f7e567960e875f", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//UP-FD-5.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//UP-FD-4.jpg", "path": "UP-FD-4.jpg", "checksum": "db0cf80beedcda203c7cf38571d17f3f", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//UP-FD-4.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//UP-FD-6.jpg", "path": "UP-FD-6.jpg", "checksum": "461058d1697fa66b8e3c2a1abdea8a9b", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//UP-FD-6.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

It will encourage the SEE countries to initiate joint natural resources management in order to promote sustainable environmental and socio-economic development of the rural and coastal cross-border areas. In this regards, the project “Solid Waste Management in cross-border rural and coastal areas of SEE region” aims to improve the conceptual and organisational framework conditions for Integrated Solid Waste Management (ISWM) in cross-border rural and coastal areas in SEE by achieving the following specific objectives:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>to asses and develop the <strong>most suitable model for integrated management of solid waste in the cross-border communities</strong>;</li>\r\n<li>to facilitate <strong>exchange of experiences and best practices</strong> among concerned stakeholders, as well as presentation of the EU context on effective solid waste management;</li>\r\n<li>to develop <strong>measures and policy recommendations</strong> which will foster the EU approximation process of future policy development and implementation;</li>\r\n<li>to set solid waste management at the agenda of the local authorities and local communities (<strong>raise awareness</strong>) and</li>\r\n<li>to strengthen the <strong>cooperation between local and central governments</strong> for establishing dialogue on future policy creation and fostering the overall development process of the cross-border and rural communities.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The project is implemented among three partners: “Network of Associations of Local Authorities in SEE” (<strong>NALAS</strong>), “Regional Rural Development Standing Working Group in SEE” (<strong>SWG</strong>), and the “Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH” (<strong>GIZ</strong>).</p>\r\n<p>Interventions of the project that will be implemented in the period <strong>July 2015 till June 2016</strong> focuses on three designated pilot areas:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Coordinated by NALAS and the respective Local Government Associations is the pilot area along the <strong>Adriatic Sea coastal region</strong> of Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. This area is affected by floating solid waste, originally derived from the rural settlements along the sea shore of Albania.</li>\r\n<li>Coordinated by SWG is <strong>Sharra mountain area</strong>, covering the cross-border rural municipalities between Macedonia, Albania and Kosovo*, as well as,</li>\r\n<li><strong>River bank areas of Drina-Sava</strong> cross-border region between Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia and <strong>river bank area of Drina-Tara</strong> cross-border region between Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The target groups of the project are: the local and national authorities, solid waste management institutions and organizations, Faculties and CSOs in the SEE countries. In this regard, 9 municipalities from four countries of the NALAS pilot area along the Adriatic Sea coastal region will be actively involved in the project implementation: Shkodra, Vau i Dejes and Lezha (ALB); Ulcinj, Herceg Novi and Bar (MNG); Neum (BiH) and Mljet, Slivno (CRO).</p>\r\n<p>It is expected the involved municipalities to contribute in the development of the most appropriate model of ISWM through the assessment process and active participation at the national events-workshops organized by respective LGAs in each of the countries. In addition, the respective experience of the municipal authorities will be utilized in the identification of challenges and needs for establishment of cross-border integrated solid waste management models within the two sessions of the Regional Dialog Platform.</p>\r\n<p>Based on the agreed models for integrated solid waste management in all three regions (mountain, river banks, and sea coast), measures and regional policy recommendations will be developed and disseminated at national and local level.

At a kick-off meeting held on 14 October 2015 in Belgrade, Serbia, with participation of some forty Mayors, directors and staff of water utility companies, the importance of asset management was discussed and the business planning tool was presented.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"Within the Asset Management Project, NALAS has developed number of tools that can help local governments and public utility companies to start implementation of the Asset Management method, such as a Toolkit on Asset Management, online course and reports on asset management practices.

This is the fourth edition of the Report prepared by the NALAS Fiscal Decentralization Task Force, as an ongoing effort to provide national and local policy-makers and analysts with reliable comparative data on municipal finances and intergovernmental fiscal relations in South-East Europe.</p>\r\n<p>As before, we present a comparative picture of what has been happening in the region as a whole, but with increasing focus on monitoring the intergovernmental finances of individual countries. The report provides a reasonably clear picture of the structure, functions, and financing of local governments in South-East Europe today, as well as an overview of how intergovernmental financial relations have evolved over the economically turbulent period 2006-2013. The report has been used by member associations to argue for policy changes at home. It has also provided input for the design of the monitoring system of the regional strategy South East Europe 2020.</p>\r\n<p>The report is divided into three sections. The first discusses the data used in the report and some basic methodological issues. The second begins with a review of the structure and functions of municipal governments in South-East Europe, as well as a few important macro-economic indicators. It then presents comparative indicators of fiscal decentralization for the region as whole. The third section focuses on the changes in intergovernmental fiscal relations that have occurred within individual NALAS’ member countries/entities.</p>\r\n<p>To download the report:</p>\r\n<p title=\"FD Report 2006-2013\"><a href=\"/Home/Download/FD_Report_2006-2013\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> FD Report 2006-2013</a></p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-FD_2006-2013.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/FD_Report_2006-2013"], "files": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/FD_Report_2006-2013", "path": "FD_Report_2006-2013", "checksum": "58edb0e68da243eea83d13d57f30033b", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Home/Download/FD_Report_2006-2013"}], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-FD_2006-2013.jpg", "path": "low-FD_2006-2013.jpg", "checksum": "79babc2de294992a046547f437ee96c0", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-FD_2006-2013.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

The size and the number of local government units may be reconsidered weighing the cost of the system and the benefit it produces in terms of accessibility to public services, the direct participatory democracy, etc. This is the case especially with countries where the size of the units of local governments is relatively small and hence the total number of units is relatively high. In SEE, such is the case with Albania, Romania, Croatia and Moldova. Furthermore the first three countries have Associations which gather smaller, rural communities. These associations may be the most affected by such territorial reform processes.</p>\r\n<p>The Albanian Government has recently adopted a new law on territorial reform abolishing the existence of rural communes and decreasing the total number of units of local government from 12 regions, 65 municipalities (urban) and 309 communes (rural) into 12 regions, 61 municipalities (urban) and 0 communes (rural). The reform obviously affects especially the NALAS member Albanian Association of Communes, who requested the assistance of the Network in dealing with the new situation, which also affects Association's existence.</p>\r\n<p>The workshop and the series of meetings helped AAC in shaping its actions after the territorial and administrative reform, but also discussed lessons learned and provided recommendations for other members who might face such process in the future.</p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-AACwshp.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-AACwshp.jpg", "path": "low-AACwshp.jpg", "checksum": "783f2097edc936e1a568b1668f509596", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-AACwshp.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

During the process, many unknown elements of the network appeared, the company was able to better shape its action, rationalize its resources, improve effectiveness and have much faster actions during the devastating floods of May 2014.</p>\r\n<p title=\"BWaterworks\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//Bwaterworks.jpg\" alt=\"BWaterworks\" width=\"322\" height=\"181\"></p>\r\n<p title=\"BWaterworks\"><a href=\"http://www.bnvodovod.com/index.php/obavjestenja/947-obiljezen-svjetski-dan-voda\">Article: Bijeljina Waterworks Website</a></p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Bijeljina.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//landfill.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Bwaterworks.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Bijeljina.jpg", "path": "low-Bijeljina.jpg", "checksum": "3f7ccba9f4e0ea64fe11e4f3d82b8bae", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-Bijeljina.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//landfill.jpg", "path": "landfill.jpg", "checksum": "125f83ec489661db1f040fa1c70ae374", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//landfill.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Bwaterworks.jpg", "path": "Bwaterworks.jpg", "checksum": "82197e8b7243f66b3df723083320fba5", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Bwaterworks.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

The workshop focused on getting feedback on the first draft of the national territorial attractiveness report including proposed national indicators for the Republic of Macedonia. In addition, the final draft of the Report describing the proposed Territorial Monitoring System/Framework was endorsed, and feedback on the first draft of the calculated joint SEE indicators acquired.  <br><br>The presentation of the Territorial Attractiveness Report was followed with a vivid discussion. The stakeholders shared their views and suggestions which helped the local expert in consolidating the national Territorial Attractiveness Report. It was emphasized that the territorial attractiveness concept should be considered at the local and regional level – closer to the citizens and by the respective institutions (the municipalities and the regional development centers).<br><br>In the frame of the project, final version of this report will become part of the trans-national report on Territorial Attractiveness in SEE.<br><br>The aim of the project “Assessing Territorial Attractiveness in SEE” is to establish a framework concept as well as tools useful for policy makers to enhance the quality of development decisions. The results of the project are to be used by policy/decision makers in improving their cooperation and networking at the South East Europe scale, in view to reinforce the role of territorial knowledge in promoting cohesion and growth in South East Europe.<br><br> <img src=\"http://www.nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/Att2new.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"313\" height=\"206\"></p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Att1new.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/Att2new.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Att1new.jpg", "path": "low-Att1new.jpg", "checksum": "c96fc3e801d0b499dc0335531af48060", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-Att1new.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/Att2new.jpg", "path": "Att2new.jpg", "checksum": "0e02cd6852521045794fc1e52b9c52c8", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/cms/Content_Data/Images/Att2new.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

But we devote less space to methodological and terminological issues and instead focus more on the changes that have occurred within countries over the last seven years.</p>\r\n<p><br>To download the full report: </p>\r\n<p title=\"Fiscal Decentralization Indicators 2006-2012\"><a href=\"/Home/Download/Fiscal-Decentralization-Indicators-2006-2012\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> Fiscal Decentralization Indicators 2006-2012</a></p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Fiscal.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/Fiscal-Decentralization-Indicators-2006-2012"], "files": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/Fiscal-Decentralization-Indicators-2006-2012", "path": "Fiscal-Decentralization-Indicators-2006-2012", "checksum": "d08d0b967d25dc70dedd300861530278", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Home/Download/Fiscal-Decentralization-Indicators-2006-2012"}], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Fiscal.jpg", "path": "low-Fiscal.jpg", "checksum": "6b34a093e57e7280d5f0654a1a7a540a", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-Fiscal.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

Moderated by Ms. Natasha Ilijeva-Acevska, NALAS Program Officer, the thematic session provoked vivid discussions and exchange. </p>\r\n<p><em>\"Mayors have to address very complex issues in providing quality services to their citizens, while the public funds for doing so are limited due to the incomplete fiscal decentralization in the region. Grants from central government meet a small part of total needs for infrastructure and services. The international donations are useful but not enough. Local governments must be innovative and introduce new sources like pooled funding.

The Report showed that the progress has been uneven, and there are few places where local government revenues or expenditures approach EU averages, either as percentages of GDP or of total public revenue. Municipalities are underfunded, and central governmetns are not giving them a fair share of the overall fiscal pie.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Pri2\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Pri2.jpg\" alt=\"Pri2\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><em>\"In negotiating with central governments for expanding the local revenue base, there are two key issues we must take care of: 1) Maintaining the overall fiscal stability of the country; and 2) How to further improve local governments' capacities to invest and borrow\"</em>, said Mr. Savov.</p>\r\n<p>Using the rich experience of the Fiscal Decentralisation Task Force, NALAS Task Force on Solid Waste and Water Management for the first time prepared Benchmarking on Solid Waste Management. <strong>Mr. Miodrag Gluscevic</strong>, from the Standing Conference of Towns and Municipalities of Serbia, and a host of the Task Force, presented the key conclusions of the Report. <em>\"The report we prepared confirmed what we already knew-we produce much less waste per capita compared to the EU countries, which reduces the interest of potential investors.

Ms. <strong>Catherine Farvacque - Vitkovic</strong> from the World Bank Group presented the Municipal Finance Self-Assessment Tool and the Urban Audit Tool that help municipalities assess their work and identify improvement potentials that lead to sustainable financial solutions for investments.  <em>\"We need two to tango.

Some 30 participants took part in the Summer School and learned how to maintain and use large data sets of municipal revenue and expenditure data to conduct sophisticated analyses of their intergovernmental finance systems. <br><br><em>\"At this Summer School, we will look at data and the use of data to tell stories that are politically compelling. Numbers alone do not dictate policy. They need to be thought in a larger story\"</em>, said in the opening lecture Mr.Tony Levitas, one of the instructors of the Summer School. <em>\"Making a judgment what numbers mean is more of an art, then a science\"</em>, said Mr.Levitas, encouraging participants to develop their skills in this direction.<br><br>The Summer School is also discussing with renowned guest speakers and the leadership of local government associations how intergovernmental fiscal analysis can be used to engage national governments in concrete discussions of reform. <em>\"We are happy to have the opportunity to support NALAS members strengthen their capacities in fiscal relations that will help them influence policies for the benefit of SEE local governments\"</em>, said Mr. Kelmend Zajazi, NALAS Executive Director.  <br><br><img src=\"http://www.nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/SS3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"426\" height=\"283\"><br><br>The session \"Apples, Oranges and Lemons\" focused on the logic and inconsistencies of budget classification schemes. If something is encoded, it can't be seen. We have to have a set of codes that distinguish the data we need, concluded participants. In many cases, data availability is also an issue. In Romania, for example, data is decentralized, so most of it stays at a county level. Therefore, it is difficult to get integrated national data. <br><br><img src=\"http://www.nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/SS2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"426\" height=\"282\"><br><br>The session \"Comparing Apples to Apples\" focused on the challenges in comparing data at the SEE level, providing suggestions for possible harmonization of problematic categories for international comparison. Typical problems with the classification of revenues relate to differences in classification of taxes, grant systems, etc. The role of NALAS has been emphasized in supporting LGAs improve their classification systems and help facilitate better regional comparison.    <br><br>In his session \"Finding what you need to know\" Dr.Jan Herczynski trained participants how to order, verify and sort large sets of budgetary and statistical data, so that they are easy to comprehend and create a meaning. In an individual exercise participants worked on ordering and reordering municipal revenue and expenditure data. Further on, participants learned how to link and sort large data sets to compare local government revenue and expenditure patterns. Also, they were introduced with the use of pivot tables as an organizational tool. <br><br><img src=\"http://www.nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/SS4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"426\" height=\"286\"><br><br><img src=\"http://www.nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/SS6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"216\" height=\"325\"><br><br>During the second day of the Summer School, discussed were the local government finance indicators, their aggregation levels as well as their use at the national and regional level for measuring financial performance. NALAS fiscal decentralization indicators were pointed out as a great example that provides national and local policy makers and analysts with reliable comparative data on municipal finances and intergovernmental fiscal relations in South-East Europe.      <br><br>The session \"Capitals and Quartiles\" provided an introduction to the distributional analysis of local government revenues and expenditures. <em>\"There is very little data on disparities at the local level, as well as instruments to</em><em> correct them and how much money is spent on it\"</em>, emphasized Mr. Tony Levitas.<em> \"What is considered acceptable disparity in revenue and expenditure in one country might be unacceptable anywhere. But to consider the question at all, the disparities have to be measured\"</em>. Therefore, this session focused on all the possible measures that can be used to determine the disparities and create appropriate financial policies to overcome them. In the next session, participants learned how to organize and analyze quartile data in order to understand equalization. They were able to practice the skills gained through individual exercises, using pivot tables, supported by the instructors.       <br><br><img src=\"http://www.nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/SS5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"426\" height=\"282\"><br><br>The afternoon session focused on framing the problem and formulating policy options for fiscal equalization. Explored were different discourses of decentralization and equalization. The instructors and participants worked on developing arguments for decentralization in ways that create more political space for active equalization policies.      <br><br><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/SS9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"425\" height=\"255\"><br><br>The last session of Day 2 of the Summer School on Local Governance and Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations focused on reading municipal budgets for gender bias. Ms. Rozeta Aleksov, Coordinator of the component \"Gender Equality at Local Level\" at the Standing Conference of Towns and Municipalities in the Republic of Serbia, opened important topics related to roles of men and women in local life and how they reflect in local policies. The session explored the concept of Gender Budgeting. <em>\"Revealing people behind the numbers is really important\"</em> emphasized Ms. Aleksov. Participants learned how to do gender-sensitive budgeting, considering all the aspects that they need to consider. Also, Ms. Aleksov presented the Serbian experiences in gender-sensitive budgeting.  <br><br><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/SS10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"426\" height=\"278\"><br><br>The third day of the Summer School on Local Governance and Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations is a discussion day. Renowned guest speakers from local government associations, Mayors, Deputy Mayors and academics joined the group of Summer School participants to discuss the dilemmas of fiscal equalization as policy and politics. <br><br><em>\"I was impressed by the intense work during the first two days of the summer school\"</em>, said in his opening speech Mr. Naim Ismajli, Mayor of Spilje, President of the Association of Kosovo Municipalities and Second Vice-President of NALAS. <em>\"Fiscal equalization becomes even more urgent in our countries as we witness high concentration of capitals and investments in the capital cities where economies thrive and the local governments in less favourable, for various reasons, fiscal position struggle to provide for best possible quality local services\"</em>.   <br><br>On behalf of the City of Ohrid, participants were welcomed by its Deputy Mayor, Mr. Angel Janev. <em>\"I wish you a warm welcome in the City of Ohrid, a magical place that combines city culture and natural heritage and beauties. We are very happy that NALAS has chosen Ohrid to host its first Summer School. Having in its network over 9,000 local governments, NALAS provides many opportunities for networking and collaboration. I invite all your associations and municipalities to consider Ohrid as a partner in your future development projects\"</em>.  <br><br><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/SS11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"428\" height=\"284\"> <br><br><em>\"For many years it was not possible to speak about fiscal decentralization. Now, thanks to the work of NALAS and our LGAs everybody speaks about it, but not much is being done\"</em>, said Ms. Ginka Chavdarova, the Executive Director of the National Association of Municipalities in the Republic of Bulgaria, the Association that hosts NALAS Task Force in Fiscal Decentralization. <em>\"Today, we have to talk in practical terms. What we do and what we can do better to improve the state o</em><em>f fiscal decentralization in SEE\"</em>.   <br><br><em>\"As a Network, we take the advantage of the current trends in the region, and work to influence policies that benefit local governments\"</em>, said Mr. Kelmend Zajazi, the Executive Director of NALAS. <em>\"One of the examples is the development of the SEE 2020 strategy for economic growth. NALAS has advocated for the idea that with fiscal federalism the region can have economic growth. We succeeded to emphasize this issue in the strategy and the action plans for its implementation</em>\".  <br><br><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/SS12.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"430\" height=\"279\"><br><br>In the session \"What do we need to know to make the case?\", the members of the NALAS Fiscal Decentralization Task Force provided an overview of the fiscal equalization systems of South-East Europe and discussed the fiscal decentralization mechanisms. <br><br><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/SS16.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"431\" height=\"227\"><br><br>The session \"Can formulas fix basic inequalities?\" discussed the hopes and achievements of fiscal equalization at sub-national level. <em>\"In the discussions before, it has been said that dealing with the issue of fiscal equalization formulas might be a potential bomb for the Local Government Associations. I would disagree. This is something that LGAs have to do, it is part of their core mission\"</em>, stressed Prof.Paul Bernhard Spahn, Professor Emeritus of Goethe University from Germany. <br><br><em>\"Without the exact financial data for all municipalities in the country you cannot have a good equalization formula. In Albania this is a difficult task\"</em>, said Mr. Fatos Hodaj, Executive Director of the Association of Albanian Municipalities. <em>\"Macedonia does not have a real equalization formula\"</em>, said Ms. Dusica Perisic, the Director of the Association of Local Self-Government Units of Macedonia.<em> \"VAT is see</em><em>n as one of the ways for equalization, but not the only way. We also look into the fee for construction land, concessions for excavation of minerals, concession on water, use of agricultural land, forestry, etc.\"</em>.  <em>\"Romania has a simple, but effective equalization system\"</em>, explained Mr.Radu Comsa, a member of NALAS Fiscal Decentralization Task Force.<em>\"The difference between poor communes and rich cities, measured in local taxes and PIT share was 8 times. Thanks to the equalization formula, it has been reduced to 2.2. By this, Romania is one of the success stories. However, in addition to this, additional money is given by discretion, which remains an issue\"</em>. <br><br><img src=\"http://www.nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/SS15.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"425\" height=\"299\"><br> <br>The session \"When the policy goal is an internal challenge\" explored the fiscal equalization as a policy and political challenge for municipal associations, as well as balancing the interests of various members. Mr. Sazan Ibrahimi, the Executive Director of the Association of Kosovo Municipalities explained the way they mobilize their membership when developing policy positions, through the 12 Collegia, that gather municipal directors. <em>\"The main challenge we had last year is the attempt of the Ministry of Finance to cut the general grants for municipalities for 2%. We brought together all municipalities, as well as our international partners and managed to stop it\"</em>, said Mr. Ibrahimi.   <br><br><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/SS17.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"426\" height=\"261\"><br><br>The last session of the first NALAS Summer School on Local Governance and Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations was entitled \"Talking to Power\". This session focused on how to translate evidence-based conclusions into political advice. Also, it explored the important points in the negotiations with the central level of government. Speakers and participants exchanged their experiences in how they make their cases and advocate for the rights of the local governments they represent. <br><br><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/SS18.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"427\" height=\"283\"><br><br>At the end of the Summer School, participants received certificates of participation. In their evaluations of the Summer School, participants expressed highest satisfaction. In their opinion, the Summer School was very useful, helping them advance their skills, but also exchange with colleagues on relevant fiscal decentralization issues. <em>\"I would like to thank NALAS for organizing this Summer School\"</em>, said Ms. Zana Djukic, a member of the NALAS Fiscal Decentralization Task Force from the Union of Municipalities of Montenegro.<em> \"The data processing training was very useful, we gained a huge knowledge which for me is new and very useful for my future work. Also, the conference on fiscal decentralization and equalization provided an opportunity for comparing and learning from each other. I am specially proud that Montenegrin data has been used in the practical exercises of the training</em>\".  <br><br><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/SS19.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"426\" height=\"283\"><br><br>After the long and busy working days, evenings of the Summer School were used to enjoy the beauties of Ohrid and learn more about the history and the culture of one of the oldest human settlements in Europe, spread around one of the Europe's deepest and oldest lakes, with more than 200 endemic species.  <br><br><img

The situation in many municipalities was serious, villages were cut-off, roads and houses were destroyed by the floods and the land slides, while citizens were displaced. The consequences of these floods were severe and the recovery is still ongoing. In this difficult period, NALAS Network demonstrated its solidarity, provided immediate help and designed actions to increase the level of preparedness of local governments and their associations to better meet all future challenges.</p>\r\n<p>The conference \"Competences and Preparedness of Local Authorities from SEE for Risk Prevention and Crisis Management\", gathered over 400 Mayors, representatives of national institutions, local governments, local government associations and donors to discuss the challenges local governments phased during the crisis, lessons learned and actions undertaken to improve risk prevention and crisis management.</p>\r\n<p title=\"GAP14\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//GAP14.jpg\" alt=\"GAP14\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The conference was opened by the President of Bulgaria, Mr. Rossen Plevenliev, who emphasized the solidarity among municipalities demonstrated during the floods in Bulgaria and the Region. <em>\"Bulgarian municipalities are committed to collaboration with the whole Region, aware that together we can do more. We are proud of this cooperation. During the devastating floods in 2014 Bulgaria was one of the first countries that offered help\"</em>, said President Plevenliev.</p>\r\n<p title=\"GAP15\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//GAP15.jpg\" alt=\"GAP15\" width=\"277\" height=\"416\"></p>\r\n<p>In the same line, in his speech, Mr. Ivan Totev, the Mayor of Plovdiv, said: <em>\"The topic of today's conference is more important than ever, for the local governments especially. Crisis are not new, what is new is our changing approach of increased solidarity demonstrated in the last years, that became evident during the 2014 crisis. I hope this conference will help us be better, prepared, cooperate better and have better results in managing crisis\".</em></p>\r\n<p title=\"GAP16\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//GAP16.jpg\" alt=\"GAP16\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Mr. Joaquin Toro, World Bank Senior Disaster Risk Management Regional Coordinator, talked about risk management in natural disasters. <em>\"The low preparedness of our countries is due to the low number of crisis we face. Although natural disasters in our region are rare, the history has shown that many of them have been devastating. On the other hand this recurrence gives more time for reconciliation and preparation for the next crisis\"</em>, emphasized Toro. <em>\"The rapid assessment that the World Bank done with the EU showed damage in value of 15% of the GDP of Bosnia and Herzegovina and 5% of the GDP of Serbia, which has severe effect of the economy and life in these countries. In these disasters, local governments were hit the most. Disaster hits cities, municipalities, not countries. Disasters start and end at the local level, but also that is where you address the risk\".</em></p>\r\n<p title=\"GAP17\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//GAP17.jpg\" alt=\"GAP17\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The session \"Local Governments respond to disasters\", was moderated by the Mayor of Sofia, Bulgaria, Ms. Yordanka Fandakova<em>. \"For me as a Mayor this topic is of an utmost importance. No matter what we do, no matter what investments we bring and make, it can all disappear in a second if we do not have a serious approach towards risk prevention\"</em>, said Ms. Fandakova. <em>\"The issue of solidarity is also very important. We, the Bulgarian municipalities have agreed to establish a solidarity fund. At the recent floods in Bulgaria we have offered immediate help, but such fund will increase the efficiency of the resources and provide fast, coordinated reaction to crisis\"</em>.</p>\r\n<p title=\"GAP18\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//GAP18.jpg\" alt=\"GAP18\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>In a very plastic and illustrative manner, Mr. Sasa Paunovic, the Mayor of Paracin, Serbia, explained the main challenges that Paracin faced during the 2014 floods and the lessons learned. <em>\"During the crisis we figured out that most of the crisis management plans have been written just to satisfy the legal requirements. For example, the river plan, done at the central level, did not consider the flooding zones. Now we know the zones and are ready for the future challenges\"</em>, said Paunovic.</p>\r\n<p title=\"GAP19\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//GAP19.jpg\" alt=\"GAP19\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Mr. Mico Micic, the Mayor of Bijeljina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, talked about the huge damages that the floods made to the region spread along Danube and Sava Rivers, the long period of recovery, but also the future risk preparedness measures undertaken, such as monitoring of water levels, adaptation of road infrastructure, cleaning the channels, river beds, etc.</p>\r\n<p title=\"GAP20\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//GAP20.jpg\" alt=\"GAP20\" width=\"236\" height=\"354\"></p>\r\n<p>During the discussion, in a very emotional speech, the Mayor of Dobrich, Bulgaria, Ms. Detelina Nikolova said: <em>\"At the moment the flood disaster in my region happened I wasn't that upset as I'm today, watching the videos and going back to what happened during these difficult times. We had many volunteers coming, people wanted to help, but we had the challenges to coordinate them. We need a law for volunteering that will put a framework, protect them and coordinate volunteers for the most effective use. As it has been proved today, NALAS is a great mechanism for exchange on this issue and creation of a joint action base</em>.</p>\r\n<p title=\"GAP21\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//GAP21.jpg\" alt=\"GAP21\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The conference was concluded with the adoption of a joint Declaration on Disaster Risk Management. The Declaration calls all relevant institutions to work together in risk prevention and crisis management, by: recognizing that disaster prevention policies are the most effective tool to achieve resilience; jointly elaborating and adopting risk reduction strategies; recognizing the importance of the regional and sub-regional inter-action and solidarity; acknowledging the importance of organized volunteer movement for providing immediate assistance.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"The Declaration summarizes all we discussed at the conference\"</em> said Ms. Fandakova, the Mayor of Sofia, Bulgaria. <em>\"I propose we adopt it unanimously and do our best to implement it in practice\"</em>.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Plovdiv 2015 Declaration\"><a href=\"/Home/Download/Plovidv_2015_Declaration\"><img

In the meantime, a few breaks to taste the local cheese, pasta and meat products and a sip or two of the best vines or liquors. Then, you already know why it is easy to say \"La vita e bella\" (Life's beautiful), not taking the smile off your face, from down until dusk. This is the experience of the charming Italian villages in the South-East Region of Puglia.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p title=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//1a13.jpg\" alt=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\" width=\"461\" height=\"309\"></p>\r\n<p title=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\">Known for its beautiful nature, Puglia, the high heel of the \"boot\" of Italy, is a home of some of the most beautiful villages in Italy. One of them, Cisternino, in the Province of Brindisi, on 26 October 2013 opened its doors for the local governments from the Mediterranean, hosting the first  conference of the most beautiful villages Network, organized by ANCI, the Italian Association of Municipalities and its partners.   <br><br><em>“Small villages are to be considered the soul of our communities, that have not remained anonymous, but people-sized places, in Italy that is a symbol of beauty, and in Europe where we live in the context of a big global village</em>”, said Fiorello Primi, the President of the Association “the Most Beautiful Villages of Italy”, that leads the newly established international network of “The Most Beautiful Villages of the Mediterranean”.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\"> </p>\r\n<p title=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//3a35.jpg\" alt=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\" width=\"301\" height=\"202\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//12345.jpg\" alt=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p title=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\">Participants had the chance to present the beauties of their towns and villages and discuss how they contribute to the sustainable development of their countries. The Conference concluded with a signing ceremony of a Memorandum of Understanding between the participants for the constitution of the association “the Most Beautiful Villages of the Mediterranean Area”, including members from Albania, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Israel, Montenegro, Palestine, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey.<br><br>The programme included site visits to some of the most beautiful villages in Puglia. The host town, Cisternino, with its white washed, stone buildings with cool, shaded, cave-like interiors, narrow streets and churches, Locorotondo, known for its round historical centre and the great wines and Alberobello, the home of the unique Trulli house constructions, were a true inspiration for the participants, offering a snapshot of how sustainable development tourism could be organized to bring tourists and generate income, but also protect the natural and cultural heritage. Participants also had a chance to visit \"masseria\" (also called \"agriturismo\"), a typical farmhouse, with its accommodation capacities, restaurant, farm, and own production of meat, cheese, olive oil and wine. </p>\r\n<p title=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\"> </p>\r\n<p title=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\"> </p>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p title=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\"> </p>\r\n<p title=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//5555.jpg\" alt=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\" width=\"255\" height=\"384\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//6666.jpg\" alt=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\" width=\"255\" height=\"383\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//7777.jpg\" alt=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\" width=\"256\" height=\"384\"></p>\r\n<p title=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\"> </p>\r\n<p title=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\"> </p>\r\n<p title=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\"> </p>\r\n<p title=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//Trulli.jpg\" alt=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\" width=\"619\" height=\"226\"></p>\r\n<p title=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\"> </p>\r\n<p title=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\">After the conference, ANCI organized the final meeting for the project \"A trans-local network for the cooperation between Italy and South-East Europe\", to present the results of the project. Amongst other activities, this project provided support to the NALAS newest Task Force in Sustainable Tourism in developing a position paper \"SEE Tourism Goes Local\" and a draft Sustainable Tourism Planning Toolkit.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\"> </p>\r\n<p title=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\"> </p>\r\n<p title=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//8a88.jpg\" alt=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p title=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\">The purpose of the Position Paper is to build a common understanding of what is sustainable tourism development at local level in SEE, to encourage sustainable tourism planning and development and to build a common reference point for local municipalities and local government associations, recognizing tourism as a relevant economic option which, in order to be successful, needs to be carefully planned and managed for continuous use in the future while still bringing benefits to the present.<br><br>In the Position Paper, NALAS states: <em>\"Tourism development is a multi-sectoral activity which takes place mainly at the local level and brings with it social, economic and environmental impacts. These require considerable planning to make the development outputs attractive to tourists while being sustainable, requiring a careful cooperation and coordination of both the private and the public sectors\"</em>.<br><br>In the upcoming period, NALAS will promote the position paper among all SEE local governments, will finalize the toolkit and will support strategic sustainable tourism planning throughout the Region.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\"> </p>\r\n<p title=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\"><em>For more information:</em><br>-Position Paper:<a href=\"/Home/Download/NALAS-POSITION-PAPER\">NALAS POSITION PAPER “SEE TOURISM GOES LOCAL”.pdf</a></p>\r\n<p title=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\"><a href=\"http://www.borghitalia.it/pg.base.php?id=6&amp;lang=enhttp://\">I Borghi Piu Belli d'Italia</a> (The Most Beautiful Villages in Italy)</p>\r\n<p title=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\"><a href=\"http://www.agriturismo.it/en/\">-Agriturismo in Italy </a></p>\r\n<p title=\"Italian villages: an inspiring story for sustainable tourism development\"> </p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Naslovna.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//1a13.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//3a35.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//12345.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//5555.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//6666.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//7777.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Trulli.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//8a88.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Naslovna.jpg", "path": "low-Naslovna.jpg", "checksum": "c377052444d292d1819ab28d668c7cdb", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-Naslovna.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//1a13.jpg", "path": "1a13.jpg", "checksum": "d26edf95972d75f9869a862273ae1219", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//1a13.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//3a35.jpg", "path": "3a35.jpg", "checksum": "8c2290bc559f21a3cdc0aaa372791d10", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//3a35.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//12345.jpg", "path": "12345.jpg", "checksum": "7a18d165d8819f2466cce8b24e4c8367", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//12345.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//5555.jpg", "path": "5555.jpg", "checksum": "de165e0968b4920c126482d03e18b4b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//5555.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//6666.jpg", "path": "6666.jpg", "checksum": "5f7e24d5335a4f48c76d97c6c5d5797b", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//6666.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//7777.jpg", "path": "7777.jpg", "checksum": "895c559bf40f785c977b63d8aac9fb8c", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//7777.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Trulli.jpg", "path": "Trulli.jpg", "checksum": "a20d05e5ef8086339a0a3b9cda87b445", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Trulli.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//8a88.jpg", "path": "8a88.jpg", "checksum": "a397d8b6e46cd5624079f4b4ca8c7a04", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//8a88.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

Turkey currently implements several huge projects related to urban development in the Bosporus, including the third airport in Istanbul, bridges, underground road infrastructure, etc. A few of the countries experience discussions for new territorial organization, or regionalization, in most of the cases without considering the opinion of the local authorities. Therefore, the group shared a bitter feeling that the SEE Region might be facing implicit wave of centralization.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p title=\"NALAS Task Force on Urban Planning: boosting urban development of SEE\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//UPTF.jpg\" alt=\"NALAS Task Force on Urban Planning: boosting urban development of SEE\" width=\"564\" height=\"344\"></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" title=\"NALAS Task Force on Urban Planning: boosting urban development of SEE\">Task Force members got the chance to learn more about the new <a href=\"http://nalas.sitecloud.cytanium.com/Home/Download/Strategicplan\">NALAS Strategic Plan (2013-2017)</a> , the plans for further development of the NALAS Knowledge Centre, and the important role that Task Forces have in the NALAS Knowledge System.

This project addresses the need for improved understanding of comprehensive territorial dynamics and improved coordination among different public policies to achieve territorial cohesion and other development goals at all levels (transnational, national, regional and local). In order to set up an effective monitoring system, the project aims to develop a ‘Common Territorial Monitoring Framework’ , together with the relevant tools. <br><br>The aim of the two day event was to review the progress of the project working packages related to the report on common territorial monitoring framework, template of action plan for establishment of territorial monitoring systems in involved regions, presentation of the draft national/regional attractiveness reports, presentation of the methodology of data model/data analysis – creation of country/region specific indicators, presentation of the draft of policy coordination process handbook and stakeholder involvement plan, etc. <br><br>The Attract-SEE project involves ten partners, an ‘EU Associated Strategic Partner’ and eight ‘Observers’ from nine countries. Steering Committee and Quality Management Board meetings were held as well. <br><br>In order to leverage the outputs of the Attract-SEE project within the NALAS regional context, a synergy between the Attract-SEE Meeting and the regular meeting of NALAS Task Force on Urban Planning was made. In that direction, a Joint Session of Attract – SEE partners and members of the NALAS Task Force on Urban Planning was organized on 25 November 2013. During the joint session, the participants had a chance to discuss solving municipal issues by the means of urban planning through the experience in Central and Eastern Europe.

This Strategy puts an emphases on the subsidiarity principle and the role of local governments in promoting economic growth. Unfortunately, in parallel, some SEE countries undergo processes that decrease the fiscal autonomy of the local government and by doing so, jeopardize economic development.   <br><br><strong>Moldova</strong> recently faced an attempt of the central government to postpone the reform of the local government, by avoiding implementation of the new legislation on local public finance. The Congress of Local Authorities from Moldova (CALM), said a strong \"no\" to the degradation of public administration system and decisive \"yes\" to local and national democracy in Moldova. Their actions included many meetings and negotiations attempts. After this did not give results, the Association organized protests of Mayors and put the financing issue in the focus of national media and the international community. CALM warned about “the consequences of non-approval of the legislation and further deterioration of local government in Moldova” extending to “all connected domains such as public administration, local and national democracy, corruption, justice and human rights\". <br><br>This was not a painless process: in pursuing their mission, CALM faced number of obstacles, such as  intimidation of mayors, direct threats, penal charges, populism and direct buying of local governments’ consent. <br><br>On 1 November 2013 the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova voted a new Law on Local Public Finances. The Law will come into force from 2015, being piloted in 2014 in 4 districts of the country: Basarabeasca, Ocnita, Riscani and Chisinau. The approval of the Law make the local self-governments hope that decentralization and local autonomy will become reality. As CALM insisted that the Law should come into force as of 2014, the struggle for democratization of Moldovan society, towards demolishing of corruption and towards significant improvement of public services is not over yet.<br><br>According to Mrs. Tatiana Badan, CALM President <em>“The experience of the Republic of Moldova during the last twenty years proves that the lack of real fiscal decentralization represents one of the key issues and main cause of unsuccessful reforms in the field of decentralization and consolidation of local autonomy. We can speak a lot about EU values in the field of local democracy and decentralization, but without real reforms and changes in the field of local public finance, all this will remain just words without any practical relevance\"</em>.<br><br>As for the new Law, Mrs. Badan emphasizes: <em>\"This law, developed during the last three years with large support of international partners and involvement of CALM, is a hope for all local governments that in Moldova things finally are moving in the right direction and decentralization can become a reality. Moreover, we think that this Law is less for local governments – it is crucial for the people of Moldova – being the single fundamental law considered by the Parliament of Moldova during last four years, which is starting the process of decentralization, radically consolidating both local and national democracy, cardinally improving the system of public administration and quality of public services in the country and essentially diminishing the level of corruption in society. Unfortunately, our politicians in the last moment and from the very narrow (political) interests, tried to stop the adoption of this extremely important law. Only due to CALM and its international partners’ pressure the law was adopted with implementation starting from 2015 and with pilot projects in 2014”</em>, concludes Mrs. Badan.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//99999.jpg\" alt=\"Protecting local government financial autonomy: the cases of Moldova and Slovenia\" width=\"508\" height=\"286\"></p>\r\n<p> Two weeks ago, <strong>Slovenia</strong> got a new Law on Property Tax. The Law has been developed without participation of municipalities in the crucial phases of the negotiations and it is dramatically affecting one of municipalities' fundamental functions: the development function. Instead of being a fully local tax, with the new Law, property tax will be shared with the central government 50%-50%. </p>\r\n<p><br>Once the proposed Law has been made public, the Association of Municipalities and Towns of Slovenia reviewed it and mobilized its membership and the national media to raise the voice against the provisions which threat local government's financial independence. A petition was organized and in one week more than 6800 signatures were collected against the proposed law and handed to the President of the National Assembly. Despite this, the Law on Property Tax was adopted on 15 November 2013. The National Council, an advisory, non-party and independent body, on 20 November voted a suspense Veto on the Law and the legislative proposal was sent back to the National Assembly. However, this did not change anything. It just prolonged the entering into force of the law and did not solve the problem. <br><br>Slovenian Mayors insist that the Law on Property Tax must encompass the following:<br>• Property Tax must be completely local tax;<br>• Understanding the financial crisis the country is facing, municipalities might only accept time limited (3 years) tax revenue sharing between municipalities and the state (50/50), after which all the revenues will go to the local level;<br>• The Law must maintain the autonomy of municipalities in managing spatial policy;<br>•Exempt or zero rate of taxation of municipal and public infrastructure, for all municipal property.<br><br>As a next step, the Association will challenge the constitutionality of the Law on Property Tax, in front of the Constitutional Court, at it endangers the future of municipalities and the citizens' quality of life. <br><br><em>\"The adopted Law further eliminates the financial autonomy of Slovenian municipalities, which is unacceptable and a strong reaction of Slovenian municipalities will be needed.

We promote an equitable development of rural and urban municipalities, young and old, men and women”. All this is reflected in NALAS daily operations, events, publications and corporate communications. <br><br>Data collected by NALAS in 2011 showed a huge gender misbalance: only 8,74% of the mayors in SEE were female and 91,26% male. Even more striking was the fact that three of the countries did not have a single female mayor. Therefore, in its new Strategic Plan 2013-2017, NALAS puts a larger accent on participation of women and youth in local life. <br><br>The new strategy includes:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Promoting exchange of experience and successful projects among members;</li>\r\n<li>Scaling up national projects;</li>\r\n<li>Becoming an Ambassador of the European Charter for Equality of Women and Men in Local Life; </li>\r\n<li>Engaging in promotion of participation of young people and women at local elections;</li>\r\n<li>Striving for a greater youth and gender balance in NALAS governing bodies;</li>\r\n<li>Developing publication policies for balanced representation of female and young issues; </li>\r\n<li>Including stories on women and young people in LG  in NALAS communication materials: newsletter, digest, website;</li>\r\n<li>Including a section of gender and youth in NALAS Knowledge Tree;</li>\r\n<li>Establishing a Focal point on Gender and Youth in each NALAS member and through them a gender and youth network.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>During its <a href=\"http://www.nalas.eu/News/NALAS-VIII-GENERAL-ASSEMBLY-GATHERS-SOUTH-EAST-EUROPE-LOCAL-GOVERNMENTS-IN-SKOPJE\">VIII General Assembly</a>,  held in April 2013 in Skopje, Macedonia, NALAS proposed that it becomes an ambassador of the <a href=\"http://www.charter-equality.eu/?lang=en\">European Charter on Equality of Women and Men in local life</a>. The delegates unanimously supported this proposal. In June 2013, NALAS officially became an ambassador of the Charter. <br><br>The Charter was originally launched in 2006 by the Council of European Municipalities and Regions (CEMR) and it is addressing local and regional governments of Europe, who are invited to sign it, and formally commit to the principle of equality of women and men, and to implement, within their territory, the commitments set out within the Charter.<br><br>The six fundamental principles of the Charter are:<br><br></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Equality of women and men constitutes a fundamental right</li>\r\n<li>To ensure the equality of women and men, multiple discrimination and disadvantage must be addressed</li>\r\n<li>The balanced participation of women and men in decision making is a pre-requisite of a democratic society</li>\r\n<li>The elimination of gender stereotypes is fundamental to achieving equality of women and men</li>\r\n<li>Integrating the gender perspective into all activities of local and regional government is necessary to advance equality of women and men</li>\r\n<li>Properly resourced action plans and programmes are necessary tools to advance equality of women and men</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The Charter also describes the specific steps which should be carried out by the signatories in order to implement the provisions of the Charter.<br><br>By becoming an Ambassador of the European Charter for Equality of Women and Men in Local Life NALAS supports CEMR in promoting the Charter among the associations and local governments of SEE, as well as boosting its implementation. <br><br>Other activities implemented by NALAS to promote gender and youth issues included:<br><br></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Survey on the activities of NALAS members in participation of women and youth in local government;</li>\r\n<li>Report on the existing literature on gender and youth, distributed to all NALAS members; </li>\r\n<li>Gender and youth section on NALAS Knowledge Tree;</li>\r\n<li>Ongoing gender-sensitive corporate communication (on the website, digests, newsletter);</li>\r\n<li>Showcasing SEE best practices in gender and youth; </li>\r\n<li>Putting gender and youth in the focus of the second <a href=\"http://nexpo.nalas.eu/\">NEXPO International Municipal Fair</a> (25-27 September 2013, Rijeka and Opatija, Croatia)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>As Moldova has some of the best practices in the gender area, at the last NALAS Board Meeting it has been decided that the Moldavian Association of Local Governments, CALM, leads NALAS group for promoting gender issues. 18% of Moldavian mayors are women and the Association has created a Women's Network, which is the voice of women in local governance in Moldova.

The group drafted the content of the NALAS Position Paper “SEE Tourism Goes Local”, which aims to build a common NALAS position on what sustainable tourism at local level means, why is it important, what are the main principles that need to be followed, who are the main stakeholders, and what are the preferred actions and recommendations.<br><br>At this meeting, NALAS Task Force on Sustainable Tourism also worked on developing a Toolkit for Strategic Planning of Tourism at Local Level. In reaching sustainability, municipalities need to apply appropriate methodology, while NALAS, as a regional network, is in the right position to promote such methodology that would be relevant and applicable all over South-East Europe. This Toolkit will provide municipalities a set of practical tools for situation analysis, strategic planning implementation and performance monitoring. The toolkit will be finalized by the end of June 2013 and promoted in the upcoming months among NALAS members. On the long run the toolkit could be developed as an e-Learning course and electronic application for producing a municipal plan for tourism development at local level.<br><br>The meeting was supported by the municipality of Sveti Kriz Zacretje, the Krapina – Zagorje County, the Association of Municipalities of Republic of Croatia, the Parliament of the Republic of Croatia and ANCI.

This was the second NALAS activity implemented in cooperation with the Local Administration Facility (LAF), the Technical Assistance and Information Exchange (TAIEX) instrument managed by the Directorate-General Enlargement of the European Commission and the Committee of the Regions. <br><br>Some 40 participants, representing municipalities from Western Balkans and Turkey took part in the study tour and learned about the EU institutions and the decision-making process, Cohesion and Regional Policy, EU 2020 Strategy and the activities for developing the SEE 2020 Strategy, IPA funds and Project Cycle Management. <br><br>Participants also benefited from the rich experiences of Slovenia, Denmark and Poland in planning and implementing regional development strategies to ensure equitable development and maximize regions' potentials. <br><br><em>\"Being here and seeing how Brussels functions has been a new, great experience for all of us. For me personally, case studies and experiences of other regions throughout Europe were of utmost importance and gave us concrete examples and ideas that we can replicate ourselves\"</em>, said Mr. Jovan Subotic, Deputy Mayor for Regional and International Cooperation, Herceg Novi, Montenegro. <em>\"Herceg Novi is city that is part of the Boka Kotorska Region, but also in vicinity to two other countries, which gives plenty of opportunities for regional cooperation. I now see how little we have done in the past to boost regional cooperation and it is now up to me as a Deputy Mayor for Regional and International Cooperation to include as many of our municipal employees to engage more in regional development\"</em>, concludes Subotic. <br><br>The study-tour helped regional and local authorities coming from the Western Balkans to identify ways of improving the existing system of distribution of public funds in accordance with financial allocations for regional development as practiced by the EU Member States. Three interactive workshops were held in small groups, focused on: 1) Implementing Regional/Local Development Strategy: process of identifying and designing key projects; 2) Long-term financial management in public administration – different models of funding projects; and 3) Project Cycle Management - primary set of project design and management tools.<br><br><em>\"I would like to emphasize the third day of the study-tour. During the first two days we learned a lot about regional development, while during the third day we had the chance to practice development and implementation of real-life regional projects. We have already applied for a joint IPA project with the Macedonian Municipality of Brvenica, and we are looking forward for many other projects to come\"</em>, said Mr. Valter Miza, Mayor of the Municipality of Bilisht, Albania.   <br><br>Within the study-tour, a visit to the Liaison Office of the State Government of Lower Austria was conducted, where participants were introduced to how local/regional offices in Brussels function and how they influence key policies that affect the local and regional authorities. <br><br>Participants had the chance to present their countries and the situation related to regional development in their respective countries, including legal framework, strategies and their implementation in practice. The study-tour was a great opportunity to learn from each others experiences, establish cooperation and network with each other. <br><br>For the delegation from Turkey, this was the first participation in an event organized by LAF. <em>\"For me, this study tour has been useful for two main reasons: first, I now understand the Balkans better and how to cooperate with them and second, I have established contacts with colleagues from different countries and I see them as our future partners for EU projects\"</em>, concluded Mr. Inan Izci, a Consultant in the EU&amp;Foreign Affairs Unit in the Municipality of Sariyer, Istanbul, Turkey. <br><br>At the end of the study-tour, NALAS presented follow-up steps that will ensure wider dissemination of the knowledge gained from the study-tour. These activities, implemented within the NALAS Knowledge Centre, will include: dissemination of the information about the event, its impact and materials through: NALAS website, Digest, Newsletter, Knowledge Tree, the network of NALAS Knowledge Management Assistants and presentation and discussion at the meetings of NALAS Task Forces. <br><br>Until the end of 2013, NALAS and LAF will organize two more joint events. <br><br>To download all training materials, please click <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/taiex/dyn/taiex-events/library/detail_en.jsp?EventID=52865\">HERE</a></p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-result.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-result.jpg", "path": "low-result.jpg", "checksum": "c72c0111f467ee78ab675040e1ea73d1", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-result.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

As an illustration, one of them stated: <em>“The recent NALAS publication, “Fiscal Decentralization Indicators for South – East Europe” is an extraordinary achievement for NALAS. The accompanying Prishtina Declaration calling on a recommitment to decentralization in SEE to facilitate European integration is an excellent example of the collective strength of NALAS in furthering the SEE voice in the European context”</em>.  <br><br>Throughout 2012, NALAS bodies collectively worked on developing its new Strategic Plan, for the period 2013-2017. Bringing NALAS to a new development level of organizational maturity, the new Strategic Plan will have four main objectives:<br><br>1. Strengthened role of NALAS Knowledge Center, as the main knowledge platform for SEE local governments. This will be achieved, among other things, by establishing NALAS E-Academy.<br><br>2. Improved and expanded NALAS services to strengthen LGAs and their member local governments in the decentralization process.<br><br>3. Interests of SEE Local Governments visible and taken into account by European institutions.<br><br>4.

What are the open issues related to the process of fiscal decentralization throughout the Region? Where and how should countries direct the future of fiscal decentralization? <br><br>These were some of the topics addressed within the International Conference: The Future of Fiscal Decentralization in South-East Europe, organized from 1-2 November 2012 in Hotel Splendid, Budva, Montenegro, by the Network of Associations of Local Government Authorities (NALAS), in partnership with the Ministry of Finance of Montenegro and the Union of Municipalities of Montenegro.<br><br>The Conference brought together over 120 participants, representing local authorities and local government associations from 12 countries in SEE; representatives of Ministries of Finance and other central government institutions from 7 countries; as well as financial institutions, international organizations, experts, CEOs and economists and boosted intergovernmental dialogue on the process of fiscal decentralization in SEE. <br><br>In his opening speech, the Minister of Finance of Montenegro, Mr. Milorad Katinic said: \"Crises force us to be more efficient, to provide better services with the money we collect. But, we also have to create better environment for economic growth, that better heals poverty and employment\".<br><br>NALAS Vice-President, Mr. Anton Pershak said: \"While assessing the trends in fiscal decentralization it is important to take into account the following general guiding aspects: (1) Implementation of the national fiscal decentralization reform agenda; (2) Level of the intergovernmental dialogue; and (3) Financial indicators. Regarding the first point, NALAS analyses conclude that there is no continuous progress in fiscal decentralization throughout the Region during the last 2-3 years. In Moldova and Romania, and even in my country, Slovenia, there is even a trend towards re-centralization\", said Pershak.<br><br>\"We agree that the process of decentralization should be perceived as a consequence of the need for democratization of the society. The economic development on the local level is a key element of meeting the needs of the people. Local development and jobs are what people primarily expect from the process of decentralization\", said Mr. Aleksandar Bogdanovic, Mayor of Cetinje and President of the Union of Municipalities of Montenegro. \"The policies implemented in Montenegro so far have given important results. I would remind that Montenegro, before the crisis, was one of the fastest growing economies in Europe, with the highest level of FDI per capita\". <br><br>\"I often hear from central governments that municipalities do not have the capacities to implement the fiscal decentralization-and this is their excuse for not advancing the fiscal decentralization process. This is simply not a valid excuse. We all have to work together to further develop the capacities of the local governments\", said Ms. Ginka Chavdarova, Executive Director of the National Association of Municipalities of Bulgaria in her speech about the challenges of the local government associations in supporting their members, the local governments, to strengthen local administrative capacities.   <br><br>\"We have to emphasize that there are three important tracks in fiscal decentralization: increase of inter-governmental transfers, increase of own revenues and removing the burdens of municipal borrowing\", said Mr. Peter Clavelle, Chief of Party of the USAID Planning and Local Governance Project in Albania. \"NALAS made a powerful study of the trends of fiscal decentralization in South-East Europe. We have used this study in our work in Albania and we have to continue doing so, we have to have an evidence-based approach in advancing fiscal decentralization\", stressed Mr. Clavell.<br><br>Mr. Anthony Levitas, a world-known expert in intergovernmental finance, alerted that: \"The level of transfers from central to local governments is insufficient for them to deliver the services they are mandated to. Throughout the SEE Region, collecting taxes remains the main problem for both central and local governments, while the \"blame-game\" between the two continues. Also, tax base throughout the SEE Region is highly concentrated in a few cities, often the capital city\".<br><br>As stressed by Mr.Gabor Peteri, International Expert, World Bank SEE Municipal Finance Review,  in the upcoming period, \"Local governments should take real control over own revenues-base, rate, exemptions and revenue administration, find new resources and develop information base and knowledge for budget negotiations and policy making, but also benchmarking for improving service management\".<br><br>During the conference, the City of Rijeka, Croatia, presented its models for financing local development projects, while the City of Istanbul, Turkey, presented its innovative financing of bus procurement.<br><br>In small working groups, national delegations discussed the main accelerators for the progress in local investment and fiscal decentralization and the key elements of success for the future. <br><br>The conference ended with a Declaration, which emphasizes the joint efforts for:<br>-Improving the results of the dialogue between the Ministries of Finance and the national associations;<br>-Expanding the municipal investment capacity in order to overcome the continuing underfunding of the municipal infrastructure;<br>-Facilitating the access of the local government to the EU pre-accession and structural/agricultural funds;<br>-Facilitating the access to the credit market.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Download the Declaration: <a href=\"http://nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Dokumenti/Budva%20Declaration%20on%20the%20Future%20of%20FD%20in%20SEE.pdf\">Budva Declaration on the Future of FD in SEE.pdf</a><br><br>To download NALAS Report: Fiscal Decentralization Indicators for South-East Europe 2006-2011, click <a href=\"http://www.nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Dokumenti/Fiscal%20Decentralization%20Report%202006-2011.pdf\">HERE</a><br><br>To view Conference photos, click <a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/110818193078428326398/BudvaConferenceOnFiscalDecentralization#slideshow/5806134254452833122\">HERE</a><br><br>To download Conference presentations, click <a href=\"http://nalas.eu/publications/NALASDecentralizationPresentations.zip\">HERE (.zip archve)</a>.</p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

Participants included CFM Project team, international, regional and local experts, NALAS Solid Waste Task Force Members and members of ZELS Environment Network.<br><br>The main purpose of the model is to help operators and municipalities calculate true cost of waste management activities, while improving cost-efficiency, improving planning and budgeting, setting tariffs, management and control of public service provider contracts, and building a database for benchmarking and comparison. <br><br>The Regional Expert Milena Radosevic (UORH) presented the draft Cost Model in details. Developed in Excel, this model, based on the Solid Waste Information System (SWIS), shows activity and budget breakdown, includes all types of costs (operation, maintenance, investments, financing), includes separate recyclable waste collection, offers a standardized way to calculate Waste Management costs and is applicable in rural and urban areas, in various size cities.<br><br>The Local Experts Mr. Miodrag Gluscevic (SCTM), Ms. Danijela Djurovic (UoM), Ms. Irem Silajdzic (SOGFBiH) and Ms. Tatiana Tugui (CALM) presented the major findings on cost structure of solid waste management situation in pilot municipalities from these four associations. <br><br>The International Expert Ms. Reka Soos presented the analysis of the foreseen main difficulties in implementation of the cost computation model, such as the complexity of the waste management economics, the need for benchmarks for basic costs, organizing the accounting system to disaggregate costs, hidden costs in administration, revenue collection, etc. <br><br>To expand the knowledge base, NALAS invited Mr. Arben Kopliku, a Deputy Programme Manager of Decentralization and Local Development Programme  (DLDP), to present the project “Developing a regional cost modeling on waste management” for Shkodra and Lezha Regions, Albania, financed by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). At the end of the presentation to each participant was handed the book “Planning Local Waste Management”. <br><br>Participants provided their feedback on how to improve the \"Cost and financing model in Solid Waste Management in South Eastern Europe\", how to find or assess the lacking information on costs, which processes to include, and how to keep the balance between simplicity and comprehansiveness of the model.

Challenges of regularisation of informal settlements of thirteen entities with diverse backgrounds in terms of economic management and political structure were assesed. Almost all are currently at different stages of a major socioeconomic transition which imposes new challenges for all sectors of economic management. Rapid urban growth has generated a dramatic increase in the need for land, services, credit and livelihood opportunities. Understandably, local governments have found it difficult to keep pace with the complexity and scale of these needs. As a result, people have resorted to self-help and various types of informal settlements have emerged in all the countries as observed by the local government associations that participated in the Study.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> </p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.nalas.eu/up/ChallengesOfRegularisation/index.aspx\">http://www.nalas.eu/up/ChallengesOfRegularisation/index.aspx</a></p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-knc823-f21.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-knc823-f21.jpg", "path": "low-knc823-f21.jpg", "checksum": "e64b42778557a6cb67f776578d24f290", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-knc823-f21.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

Members of Iraqi Parliament and officials of Baghdad Governorate and local councils highly appreciated the expertise provided by NALAS in a conference held in Erbil/Northern Iraq. <br><br>NALAS Knowledge Center accumulates the experience of member local government associations and makes them available for local governments in South East Europe through different forms and methods. Extending its knowledge disseminating capacity to broader neighbourhood, NALAS co-organised with IRD/USAID a conference in Erbil/Iraq in order to share the region’s know-how in local government reforms. The Conference in Iraq held last week showed vividly that the use of such experience-based knowledge is of high value even beyond the geographic area of South East Europe (SEE). This is the case especially in countries with emerging democracy, where the local government system is just taking shape and where the multi-ethnic societies heal wounds from violent clashes. At the closing session of the Conference, the Member of the Iraqi Parliament, Mr. Kadhim al-Shimri, congratulated the organisers for what he qualified as “the highest quality conference held since 2003 in Iraq”, since the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime. For security reasons, the event took place in Erbil/Northern Iraq. <br>The conference titled \"Cooperation between local governments in South East Europe and Iraq and Experience Sharing\" was organized by the USAID funded Iraqi Community Action Program with support of NALAS. Over 100 representatives of Baghdad Governorate, district and sub-district councils as well as four members of national Parliament attended. NALAS experts presented the state of decentralisation in SEE with the special focus on local government reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Croatia and Turkey. Council Members of Baghdad showed great interest in SEE experiences to shed light on their search for local government management model. <br>The Slovenian Association (SOS) Secretary General, Ms. Jasmina Vidmar explained the interaction between members of city council and citizens in EU countries, portraying her own experience as a Council Member of the City of Maribor in three mandates. While the Director for International Cooperation of the Union of Municipalities of Marmara, Mr. Murat Daoudov delivered his presentation in Arabic language on local government system in Turkey and the role of UMM in providing services to municipalities. NALAS Executive Director, Mr. Kelmend Zajazi provided  an overview of the local government legislation in SEE, the reform drivers, including the Charter of Local Self Government of the Council of Europe, as well as the common obstacles which the countries in transition have faced in their decentralization path.  <br>At the second day of the conference, Mr. Amir Kupusija explained Bosnia and Herzegovina experiences in involving citizens in the local government function, while Mr. Mladen Ivanovic from the Croatian Association of Communes described how decentralisation in Croatia served as the main instrument to restore trust and reconcile in the aftermath of recent wars in the Balkans. Finally, Ms. Natasha Acevska from NALAS Secretariat provided more details about the fiscal decentralisation reforms with an overview of the local government revenue structure in SEE.<br>No doubt that the Balkan experience in transitioning from the legacy of centralised socialism into a local democracy in a post conflict context drew great level of interest from Iraqi officials who face tremendous challenges in searching for the right model to develop their local government system and in the same time overcome internal ethnic and religious conflicts. Over 200 Iraqi local government councillors have been killed in the past few years during the civil unrest. However, it was impressive to see how these local leaders are interested and committed to move the process forward amid the security threats of their own lives. <br>Encouraged by the experience of Erbil conference, NALAS and IRD intend to organises a follow-up event for Iraqi local officials in South East Europe. Commenting on the success of the event, NALAS President Vladimir Moskov said: “In line with its Strategic Plan, NALAS will extend its knowledge sharing to neighbouring regions and broaden the geographic scope of its cooperation to the emerging democracies”.  </p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-nalaslogo.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-nalaslogo.jpg", "path": "low-nalaslogo.jpg", "checksum": "d60681272847e6001fcba0df0c7fc0a8", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-nalaslogo.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

This was also a closing conference of the two NALAS projects - “Local Borrowing” and “Development of a Manual for Efficient Sanitary Landfill Management”. The discussions showed that the main obstacles for implementation of good waste collection services at the local level are the finances, where the local government borrowing, if used wisely, is certainly one good tool for overcoming these obstacles and supporting municipal investments. <br><br>The group was welcomed by the mayor of Yildirim municipality and NALAS Vice-president Mr. Ozgen Keskin. He and his team presented many successfully municipal projects like: Kaplikaya attraction center, Children’s education and science center, the Peace palace, Yildirim Municipality Patients relatives facility, etc.<br><br>AKM emphasized the relevance of issues raised in the landfill management report and the potential usage of findings and recommendations from relevant institutions. The landfill management project analyzed the current status of waste disposal in SEE, and based on the findings developed recommendations for future improvements. Data reveal that national plans and strategies in the project region are based on EU norms and targets but, it is very likely that more realistic plans, prepared in cooperation with the municipalities and based on the needs and possibilities, would speed up the overall implementation process. Findings also reveal that political support is crucial to successful landfill management. Successful case studies were the ones that received exceptional high support and commitment from local policy makers. The discussions raised a number of concerns related to sustainability of waste management in the region, but also ideas and suggestions on how to best address them.<br><br>In a separate event, the directors of the member associations of local authorities forming the statutory body recognized as “NALAS Committee of Liaison Officers” gathered in the 17th to discuss important issues like the rotating presidency, hosting of NEXPO 2013 and the preparations for the General Assembly in 2012.<br><br>The experts of the Task Force on Fiscal Decentralisation also held their technical meeting focused mainly on the Benchmarking of Intergovernmental Finances in SEE. The fruits of their labour on this topic will be published during the first months of 2012.<br><br>Bursa, once a capital of the Ottoman State and also home of the famous Turkish dishes contributed just as much with great inspiration and hospitality.

But in particular since the 1980s, and responding to European and global challenges, local governments have been far more involved in partnerships which focus on local development.</p>\r\n<p>In Europe, it was in particular the development of the EU’s cohesion policy, financed through the structural funds, which led to and inspired an upsurge in project-based partnerships between cities, towns and regions.

The Cotonou Agreement between the EU and the ACP countries (Africa, Caribbean, Pacific) explicitly recognizes local authorities as development actors, and since 2007, local governments have had access to a specific thematic programme with about €30m a year.</p>\r\n<p>For twinnings to really succeed as instruments for development, we can learn some lessons from experience in Europe and across the world:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The development project must relate to an important problem identified by the partner local government, which must “own” the project from the outset</li>\r\n<li>Clear objectives, a statement of expected results, and performance indicators should be set for the development project before it begins, and the project should be jointly planned</li>\r\n<li>The subject of the partnership should relate to a competence shared by all partner local governments</li>\r\n<li>The financial and in-kind contributions from each partner should be made explicit from the outset</li>\r\n<li>The role and contribution of other actors in the partnership, e.g. civil society organisations at each end of the partnership, should also be explicit from the outset</li>\r\n<li>Even if the partnership is more for the practical benefit of one partner, it is better if all partners can demonstrate benefits from it (e.g. staff development, involvement of local communities)<br> </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Social Inclusion</h2>\r\n<table id=\"table11\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"50\"><img src=\"http://old.nalas.eu/events/2011-03-10-NEXPO/Kunz-50x50.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\"></td>\r\n<td><strong>Kurt Kunz</strong>,<br>SDC</td>\r\n<td width=\"50\"><img src=\"http://old.nalas.eu/events/2011-03-10-NEXPO/moskov-50x50.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\"></td>\r\n<td><strong>Vladimir Moskov</strong>, <br>NALAS President</td>\r\n<td width=\"50\"><img src=\"http://old.nalas.eu/events/2011-03-10-NEXPO/bozic-50x50.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\"></td>\r\n<td><strong>Darko Bozic</strong>,<br>City of Belgrade</td>\r\n<td width=\"50\"><img src=\"http://old.nalas.eu/events/2011-03-10-NEXPO/Jakimovski-50x50.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\"></td>\r\n<td><strong>Stevco Jakimovski</strong>,<br>Municipality of Karpos</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"50\"><img src=\"http://old.nalas.eu/events/2011-03-10-NEXPO/tatjana-50x50.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\"></td>\r\n<td><strong>Tatjana von Steiger Weber</strong>,<br>SDC</td>\r\n<td width=\"50\"><img src=\"http://old.nalas.eu/events/2011-03-10-NEXPO/Marin-50x50.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\"></td>\r\n<td><strong>Vasile Marin</strong>,<br>Hincesti Rayon</td>\r\n<td width=\"50\"><img src=\"http://old.nalas.eu/events/2011-03-10-NEXPO/Hajder-50x50.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\"></td>\r\n<td><strong>Ermin Hajder</strong>,<br>Municipality of Bosanski Petrovac</td>\r\n<td width=\"50\"><img src=\"http://old.nalas.eu/events/2011-03-10-NEXPO/Shlafli-50x50.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\"></td>\r\n<td><strong>Kuno Schläfli</strong>,<br>SDC</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"50\"><img src=\"http://old.nalas.eu/events/2011-03-10-NEXPO/cingil-50x50.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\"></td>\r\n<td><strong>Bülent Hamdi Cingil</strong>,<br>Yenisehir / Bursa</td>\r\n<td width=\"50\"><img src=\"http://old.nalas.eu/events/2011-03-10-NEXPO/Arnold-50x50.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\"></td>\r\n<td><strong>Pascal Arnold </strong>,<br>Intercooperation</td>\r\n<td width=\"50\"><img src=\"http://old.nalas.eu/events/2011-03-10-NEXPO/kohil-50x50.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\"></td>\r\n<td><strong>Richard Kohli</strong>,<br>SDC</td>\r\n<td width=\"50\"><img src=\"http://old.nalas.eu/events/2011-03-10-NEXPO/dimova-50x50.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\"></td>\r\n<td><strong>Marina Dimova</strong>,<br>UNDP</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"50\"><img src=\"http://old.nalas.eu/events/2011-03-10-NEXPO/zajazi-50x50.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\"></td>\r\n<td><strong>Kelmend Zajazi</strong>,<br>NALAS</td>\r\n<td width=\"50\"> </td>\r\n<td> </td>\r\n<td width=\"50\"> </td>\r\n<td> </td>\r\n<td width=\"50\"> </td>\r\n<td> </td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p><em>Promoting social inclusion: an opportunity and/or an obligation for mayors?</em></p>\r\n<p>All mayors share a common vision to improve the lives of their citizens.

Local governments are also an important place for citizens to participate in decision-making processes and to ensure that their voices are heard when it comes to development priorities. Due to this closeness between local governments and citizens, mayors indeed have unique opportunities, and also obligations, to support the wellbeing of all of their citizens.</p>\r\n<p>There are many measures that mayors can take to improve social inclusion in their municipalities, like improving education services, supporting job creation and ensuring inclusive local development planning. The experience of the mayors attending this conference includes many creative and effective initiatives. In order to share these experiences and to discuss the role of mayors and of their development partners in improving social inclusion, NALAS and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation are hosting a conference on social inclusion as part of the NEXPO.</p>\r\n<h2>Benchmarking</h2>\r\n<table id=\"table12\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"50\"><img src=\"http://old.nalas.eu/events/2011-03-10-NEXPO/musch-50x50.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\"></td>\r\n<td><strong>Arne Musch,</strong><br>VNG International\r\n<p class=\"pdf\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> <a href=\"http://old.nalas.eu/events/2011-03-10-NEXPO/W1%20-%20Presentation%20benchmarking%20NEXPO%2010%20March%202011.pdf\">Presentation</a></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td> </td>\r\n<td> </td>\r\n<td> </td>\r\n<td> </td>\r\n<td> </td>\r\n<td> </td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>The purpose of decentralization is to deliver high quality, efficient and accessible public services.

The General Assembly was opened by the Royal Highness the Prince of Asturias. <br><br>\"Decentralization is a political process. It is a means but not an end. The end is to ensure a better quality of life for our citizens\", \"The new elements of the Structural Funds will include: Integrated Territorial Investments, Community-Based Local Development and Urban Innovative Actions\", \"Our current forms of governance are not suited to cope with changes such as climate change\", \"The City of Stuttgart in Germany invested 8 million EUR in energy efficiency in public buildings and in five years it saved 12 million EUR\"; \"Crisis also bring opportunities, and innovation is one opportunity more\", \"Thinking about innovations, local governments should make sure they have the 4C: competitive advantage, choices to make, critical mass and collaboration\"-these were some of the statements made by panelists and delegates during the General Assembly of European Municipalities and Regions. <br><br>NALAS President, Dr. Ozgen Keskin gave a speech about the second NEXPO International Municipal Fair, that will be held in the Cities of Rijeka and Opatija, the Republic of Croatiia, 25-27 September 2013. \"For my distinguished Mayor colleagues, NEXPO is a great opportunity to: present their Municipality, meet new people, learn new things, exchange experiences and best practices\", said Dr. Keskin. \"Also, NEXPO might bring future benefits for your Municipality. You will be able to: present your Municipality potentials, competitive advantages, investment projects, meet potential investors, establish partnerships and get in touch with potential donors. Additionally, NEXPO opens its doors for the potential investors:  businesses, banks, vendors of municipal services\". <br><br>NALAS had its stand during the General Assembly of European Municipalities and Regions, where it presented NEXPO 2013 and NALAS work in general. <br><br>During its stay in Cadiz, NALAS delegation met a delegation of Ukraine Associations of Local Government, supported by the Council of Europe, who already expressed interest to become NALAS associate members and attend NEXPO 2013. NALAS President stated that NALAS is determined to share experiences with other developing regions outside the borders of South-East Europe. <br><br>Also, NALAS met the Mayor of Athens, Dr. Yiorgos Kaminis and reconfirmed NALAS interest to reactivate the membership of the Greek Association of Local Authorities, which was also one of founding members of NALAS. Dr. Kaminis learned more about NALAS and committed to follow-up on this issue. \"In the times of crisis, that Greece faces today, instead of closing inside, we should open to the world, now, more than ever\", said Dr. Kaminis.<br><br>On 25 September, NALAS held its Board meeting. NALAS Liaison Officers discussed and made decisions on issues important for the future work and sustainability of the Network, such as: NALAS strategy 2013-2017, new membership fees, expanding NALAS membership, NEXPO 2013, upcoming Conference on Fiscal Decentralization and more. It is certain that NALAS has became a strong and influential network, that makes visible changes in the Region. The new strategy and the increased financial independence will provide for this impact to continue growing in future, for the benefit of the citizens of the region of South-East Europe and beyond.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p title=\"NALAS Presents Its Work on the 25th General Assembly of CEMR\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//Picture1.jpg\" alt=\"NALAS Presents Its Work on the 25th General Assembly of CEMR\" width=\"313\" height=\"157\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//Picture2.jpg\" alt=\"NALAS Presents Its Work on the 25th General Assembly of CEMR\" width=\"219\" height=\"158\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//Picture3.jpg\" alt=\"NALAS Presents Its Work on the 25th General Assembly of CEMR\" width=\"212\" height=\"158\"></p>\r\n<p title=\"NALAS Presents Its Work on the 25th General Assembly of CEMR\"> </p>\r\n<p title=\"NALAS Presents Its Work on the 25th General Assembly of CEMR\"> </p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Cadiz-za-web.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Picture1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Picture2.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Picture3.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Cadiz-za-web.jpg", "path": "low-Cadiz-za-web.jpg", "checksum": "c1737296066252af9c500aff49d2face", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-Cadiz-za-web.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Picture1.jpg", "path": "Picture1.jpg", "checksum": "bd4abb9aeee414553681581c8a1817ae", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Picture1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Picture2.jpg", "path": "Picture2.jpg", "checksum": "f585b8bea90cd176c2536dfc419fa2a3", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Picture2.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Picture3.jpg", "path": "Picture3.jpg", "checksum": "301f7e0b1145c178983ecad96483a3f3", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Picture3.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

They called for the European Commission to recognize local governments as key actors in programming and utilization of the EU pre-accession funds (IPA), especially on the eve of the next IPA programming cycle for the period 2013 to 2018 and beyond. <br><br>The EC has already started a consultation process to improve IPA, being the main pre accession financing instrument. This is viewed by NALAS as an opportunity to put in practice the principle of multi-level governance where all levels of government will share responsibilities to maximize and speed up the reforms in this part of Europe. <br><br>President Bresso welcomed the extension of the Covenant of Mayors to the Western Balkans which was earlier requested through a common declaration adopted by all Presidents of fourteen (14) NALAS member associations, endorsed by the Council of European Municipalities and Regions (CEMR[2]), Energy Cities[3] and the European Foundation for the Sustainable Development of the Regions (FEDRE[4]), with the support of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe (CLRA). The Covenant of Mayors is considered as one of the most powerful bottom-up initiatives undertaken by local and regional authorities, mobilizing more than 2000 local authorities from 42 countries. Through this initiative, local governments from SEE are also eager to go beyond the energy and climate objectives of the EU, however, related technical assistance and appropriate financial mechanisms are essential to meet expectations.<br><br>Presidents Bresso and Moskov also recognized the positive role of the CoR Joint Consultative Committees and Working Groups, and expressed strong commitment to further explore other forms of cooperation between the CoR and NALAS in order to strengthen the awareness and involvement of local governments in preparations for accession to EU. Furthermore the decentralization experience in SEE was viewed also as a valuable resource for extension of the European eastern partnership.<br><br>NALAS has been established in the frame of the Stability Pact and the support of the Council of Europe. Its mission is to actively encourage the decentralization process in South East Europe through strengthening and connecting Local Government Associations and thereby contribute to democracy and stability in the region, and subsequently to faster and successful EU integration. <br><br><br>[1] www.nalas.eu<br>[2] www.ccre.org<br>[3] www.energy-cities.eu<br>[4] www.fedre.org/en</p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-NALASCoRDEC2010210.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-NALASCoRDEC2010210.jpg", "path": "low-NALASCoRDEC2010210.jpg", "checksum": "fe50a8e5e534eb6a2287778a3eb07b9b", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-NALASCoRDEC2010210.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

The conference presented and discussed results of the SCTM-lead project “Comparative Analysis of Legal Frameworks Relevant for Urban Planning in South-East European Region”. The project’s objective was to compare and assess relevant legislation in South East Europe, and make recommendations for preventing further development of informal settlements while regulating the existing ones. <br><br>It involved 13 urban planning experts from NALAS members in South East Europe, and was implemented by the SCTM over the past 11 months, with support of the GIZ-Open Regional Fund for South East Europe. <br><br>The meeting brought together urban planning experts, representatives of municipalities, associations of local self-governments and relevant ministries from South East Europe, as well as international organizations. <br><br>The Network of Associations of Local Authorities represents more than 4,000 local authorities from South East Europe. It is recognized by the RCC Strategy and Work Programme 2011-2013 as the most relevant partner in promoting cooperation at this level. The RCC Secretariat and the NALAS work to improve links between local authorities, governmental bodies and EU institutions.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> </p>\r\n<p

The meeting provided an overview of the developments since the last session of the Task Force, held in November 2011 in Bursa, Turkey. <br><br>The Task Force members discussed NALAS Report:<a href=\"http://www.nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Dokumenti/NALAS-FDIndicators.pdf\">Fiscal Decentralization Indicators in South East Europe</a>. The report, which provides reliable comparative data on municipal finances and intergovernmental fiscal relations in South-East Europe, attracted high interest among the wider expert community. The Task Force members brainstormed on further dissemination and promotion of the report and its findings within the Associations, how it could get its way to all local authorities in the Region and be used for lobbying and advocacy. <br><br>Also, the Task Force discussed the next issue of the Report and its methodological and organizational challenges. Since the NALAS Knowledge Management Assistants will have an important role in data collection and findings dissemination, a group of Knowledge Management Assistants also took part in the meeting. In addition, they had their own parallel meeting with the new NALAS Knowledge and Communication Manager to discuss their future activities. <br><br>The Fiscal Decentralization Task Force members also discussed the concept for the upcoming conference \"The Future of Fiscal Decentralization in SEE\", to be held from 1-2 November 2012 in Budva, Montenegro. The conference would bring together ministries of finance, mayors, policy makers and major economy players from SEE to discuss, strategize and develop a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing the region in finding the right ways to finance projects and activities of sustainable local development. <br><br>The documentary \"Urbanized\" opened a debate on \"Land Financing and Infrastructure Development in SEE\", which raised the issue on how cities find adequate ways of financing a proper land development and infrastructure investments. A significant trend was noted in SEE that local governments voluntarily give up parts of their own incomes (like land development fees) in order to be more competitive for foreign investors and therefore contribute to local economic development and boosting employment in the municipality. The leading dilemma was if this trend is hampering the stability of the local budgets on the long run and which tools and mechanisms should be used in protection of the fiscal sustainability of the local governments. The conclusion was that there is no written formula and that only comprehensive and smart long-term planning supported by the elected leaders can provide the balance. Especially important and useful ways for supporting this are the utilization of public-private partnerships and EU funds for development of the local infrastructure.</p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-brussels-moskov-milena.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-brussels-moskov-milena.jpg", "path": "low-brussels-moskov-milena.jpg", "checksum": "001fca47db3653d4a90c3ecb4ba9e4b7", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-brussels-moskov-milena.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

Numerous reforms have been made concerning the practices of these governments, as well as the functions of subnational authorities. These legislative and organisational modifications, often initiated by local governments, call into question the role of the local and regional level within the inner workings of states. <br><br>The purpose of this publication is to provide a picture as complete as possible of the reforms that have been put in place since the beginning of the crisis. Sixty years after the signing of the European Charter of Municipal Liberties in 1953, this study also aims to present an overview of the consequences of the crisis on local and regional autonomy in Europe. The budget restrictions currently in place, the tendencies by national governments to recentralise competences, as well as the ever increasing disengagement of states all weaken the freedom of local and regional authorities to act. It is therefore necessary to highlight the importance of local governments in the definition of a new political project in Europe.<br><br>To download the publication:</p>\r\n<p title=\"Decentralisation at a crossroads-Territorial reforms in Europe\"><a href=\"/Home/Download/Decentralisation-Territorial-Europe\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> Decentralisation at a crossroads-Territorial reforms in Europe</a></p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-CEMR123.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/Decentralisation-Territorial-Europe"], "files": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/Decentralisation-Territorial-Europe", "path": "Decentralisation-Territorial-Europe", "checksum": "9f45e0205dfdf8ecad21aca1c7f90410", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Home/Download/Decentralisation-Territorial-Europe"}], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-CEMR123.jpg", "path": "low-CEMR123.jpg", "checksum": "f0b24f4b9a8cb6a39fe6c9d991455435", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-CEMR123.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

Five years is not much in the life of an association, yet it is enough to stop and reflect: have the original aims been reached? Should they be re-assessed? It is for NALAS and for NALAS only to imagine what its next 5 or 10 years should consist of, but one thing is sure: CEMR will be there, by your side, in future</em>”.</p>\r\n<p>NALAS Executive Director Kelmend Zajazi stressed that NALAS has achieved much progress in the past 5 years: “however, the following 5 years will be crucial. We must provide the services our members expect from NALAS, mainly in the field of fiscal decentralization, in order to ensure the quality delivery of public services to citizens in the region, especially now that local authorities face a global economic and financial crisis.

should include specific local government-related priorities, and should also ensure that the local government dimension of other broad priorities (e.g. equal opportunities, social inclusion etc.) is clearly identified</li>\r\n<li>A significant proportion of pre-accession financing should be dedicated to sub-national governments, in consultation with central governments, to enable them to prepare properly for EU membership</li>\r\n<li>To this end, there should be specific programmes or budget lines for local and regional governments, with processes adapted to their role and situation as

governments closest to citizens, we need to build a “European dimension” to our work, bringing Europe closer to our citizens, involving them in big EU issues and providing good

services, achieve positive results for citizens, and attract inward investment</li>\r\n<li>Our local development strategies need to be well-planned, participatory and citizen-focused, and able to make

We, as mayors, will need to deal with these consequences at local level because we are the authorities closest to the people, and even though climate change is a global process, its effects have strong influence and affect and should be dealt with by the local communities\"</em>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> </p>\r\n<p title=\"NALAS Presidents Meeting: Climate Change on Local Governments' Agenda in South-East Europe\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//Intro1.jpg\" alt=\"NALAS Presidents Meeting: Climate Change on Local Governments' Agenda in South-East Europe\" width=\"778\" height=\"381\"></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" title=\"NALAS Presidents Meeting: Climate Change on Local Governments' Agenda in South-East Europe\">NALAS’ members, the associations of local authorities, proved that they are aware of the challenges and are trying to contribute to the joint effort to mitigate the effects of the climate change.

NALAS members agreed to send a letter to United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), supporting their eight recommendations for Rio+20, and further enhancing them to emphasize the important role that local governments play in ensuring sustainable future for all. <br><strong><span style=\"color: #4f6128;\"><br><span style=\"color: #92d050;\">\"The role of local authorities and the processes of decentralization and consolidation of local autonomy at all levels (including communes and small towns) has to be recognized in the Rio+20 Conference Declaration, as this is a prerequisite for implementing direct changes in the local communities to deal with climate change. </span></span></strong><br><br>Sustainable actions to deal with climate change by local authorities assume a very broad and multi-dimensional perspective, including creation of a whole spectrum of climate-friendly local environment, in partnership with other actors, such as the civil society and private sector.

For comparison, such offices are established or planned to be established for the neighboring countries from the Eastern Partnership and Central Asian Cities, and North Africa. Therefore, NALAS sent a letter to the President of the European Commission Hose Manuel Barroso to advocate for opening such an office and followed-up with the Director General of DG Enlargement Stefano Sannino and Mercedes Bresso, the President of the Committee of the Regions.<br><br>Participants agreed that NALAS should strive to conclude the process for establishing of Covenant of Mayors Office to cover the whole South Eastern Europe. The conclusions for the immediate steps that are to be taken include:<br><br>· The National Association of Municipalities in the Republic of Bulgaria will be proposed to lead the Initiative as Mr. Vladimir Moskov was the NALAS leader during whose presidency the initiative started.<br><br>· Mr. Vladimir Moskov will propose the initiative to be discussed at the relevant working groups of the Committee of the Regions.<br><br>· The mayors from the candidate and potential candidate countries for European Union membership who are Covenant’s signatories to start a petition which is to be presented to the European Commission.<br><br><span style=\"color: #1f497d;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">OTHER NALAS MEETINGS</span></strong></span><br><br>During the Presidents meeting, NALAS also organized a meeting of its Task Force on Association Development and a meeting of NALAS Liaison Officers.

This is a unique place, which very much correlates with what we were discussing during these two days. The natural heritage has to be protected not only here, but in the whole world. As we heard from one of the presenters, each day the World spends an energy equal to 400.000 atomic bombs. Each person on the Earth has to seriously think about what we do and how it affects our lives-that is why this topic is very relevant and important in general and in particular, in NALAS work. The conclusion I take from the meeting is the importance of the use of renewable energies, that won't pollute and will provide better and cleaner lives. We, the leaders, and important organizations like NALAS have to offer support to make this reality.\" <em>(Mr. Ahmed Bashev, Vice President, National Association of Municipalities in the Republic of Bulgaria)</em><br><br>\"This is my first experience with NALAS after NEXPO 2011 and from what I have seen I must say that I am delighted-the networking and exchange of experiences really enriched us. The NALAS task forces and all the knowledge they have produced is a valuable resource for the local authorities which has to expand in future, for the benefit of all associations and local governments\".  <em>(Mr. Darko Fras, Vice President of the Association of Municipalities and Towns of Slovenia)</em><br><br>\"It is important to raise the awareness of local governments about their role in fighting the climate change. In that respect, meeting in Tulcea organized by NALAS was of utmost importance. First of all it gave us the forum to discuss related issues and, second, it enabled us to hear how local governments in SEE are already fighting the climate change. Looking globally, this micro-effort is an excellelent cotribution to the global goals\".<em> (Mr. Mladen Ivanovic, Coordinator of the Association of Municipalities in the Republic of Croatia)</em><br><br>\"For me the meeting on climate change was very informative, we found out more about the NALAS Project on climate change that is still open for other countries.\" <em>(Ms. Vesna Travljanin, Director of the Association of Municipalities and Cities of the Federation of Bosnia Herzegovina)</em><br><br>\"I think it is very good that NALAS organized this meeting on the globally important topic of climate change, which has to be of interest for all of us in the countries of South-East Europe and their local self-governments. Presenters during the conference had very interesting presentations, while participants provided their contribution during the discussions. Some of the information we heard sound very alarming and we all need to do something to change world's environment\". <em>(Mr. Rajko Golubovic, Secretary General of the Union of Municipalities of Montenegro)</em><br><br>\"It is very important that NALAS decided to put this issue on its agenda. Dealing with issues related to nature, its devastation and climate change could not be dealt individually by countries, they go over regional borders and have to be jointly addressed. We at NALAS always aim to address issues that are joint for the Region, and what could be more important than the safety of the citizens of the region and living free of natural disasters. The presentations of the experts in climate change were very informative about the situation in the world, while we provided contribution on the situation in our region\". <em>(Ms. Ginka Chavdarova, Executive Director of the National Association of Municipalities in the Republic of Bulgaria)</em><br><br>\"The Presidents Meeting focusing on climate change was good, many experiences were shared. Our Association is leading NALAS Task Force on Energy Efficiency and is part of the \"Think Globally, Develop Locally\" Project financed by UNDP.

Both the population and the authorities are embracing the prospect of EU integration with seriousness and enthusiasm and these are important drivers for reforms in view of accession\"</em>. <br><br>The Montenegrin JCC co-chair Miomir Mugoša, the President of the Governing board of Union of Montenegro Municipalities (UoM) and the Mayor of Podgorica, pointed out that the strengthening of local governments' administrative capacities requires coordination between all levels of government. <em>\"Only competent and well-engaged local governments can implement the necessary reforms that can eventually lead to the improvement of the quality of life of our citizens\"</em>, stressed Mugoša.<br><br>H.E. Ivan D. Leković, Ambassador and Head of the Mission of the Republic of Montenegro to the EU, expressed his satisfaction as regards the pace of the accession talks and highlighted the current preparation of the country's Accession Program: <em>\"The Montenegrin Government is preparing the Accession Program of Montenegro for the period 2014-2018, which includes harmonization plans with the EU acquis. Municipalities certainly have a role to play in this process, especially in regard to those chapters where their representatives sit on the negotiating teams, namely on fisheries, transport, social policy and employment, as well as regional policy and coordination of structural instruments\"</em>.<br><br>Among the main focus of the JCC meeting was the adoption of the first Report on \"Increasing absorption capacity of EU pre-Accession funds and improving administrative capacity at the local level in Montenegro\" jointly prepared by Alexandar Bogdanovic, the President of the UoM’s Assembly and the Mayor of Cetinje, and Witold Stępień (PL/EPP), Marshal of the Łódź voivodship. Emphasizing the need for training and sharing of experiences to improve local administrative capacity, the Report calls on the EU institutions to continue their support and recommends the continuation of the Local Administration Facility (LAF) program. The co-rapporteurs furthermore stressed the positive impact of cooperation mechanisms both between municipalities in Montenegro but also across borders in increasing absorption and administrative capacities. The delivery of the Report will be relevant in the context of the upcoming opening of the negotiations on the chapter of regional policy and structural instruments.<br><br>On the issue of fiscal decentralization, discussions centered on the necessity for adequate financing to underpin the decentralization of administrative responsibilities at local level. Participants also pointed out that a right balance has to be found between local governments' independence in using funds and the needs of public finances. Marija Ćatović, Mayor of Kotor (Montenegro), referred to the gaps in local financing which have led to a rise of debt levels of Montenegrin municipalities. She underlined that effective fiscal decentralization should be linked to a precise definition of the tasks and competences of local governments.<br><br>Mr. Vladimir Moskov, a former NALAS President and Mayor of Goce Delcev in Bulgaria, presented NALAS Report \"Fiscal Decentralization Indicators for South-East Europe: 2006-2011\". This report provides a reliable snap shot of the structure, functions, and financing of local governments in SEE  today, as well as an overview of how intergovernmental financial relations have evolved over the economically turbulent period 2006-2011. The report has been used by NALAS member associations and other stakeholders in formulating fiscal decentralization policies. <br><br>The next JCC meeting will be held on 30 June 2014 in Kotor, Montenegro. This meeting will focus on agriculture and rural development, as well as services of general interest.</p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-JCC1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-JCC1.jpg", "path": "low-JCC1.jpg", "checksum": "73a48b3c31f49353b8ea2afb4ebf1189", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-JCC1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

What are the key urban development challenges that need to be addressed?<br><br><strong>A:</strong> Probably the most challenging aspect would be to facilitate the development process (and to ensure its territorial dimension) in a different manner than a supply-driven approach.  So far, the discretionary, politicised and uncoordinated way of channelling the resources has deepen the territorial imbalances – therefore, in my opinion we are in an unfortunate situation of rather correcting the previous endeavours, and more deeply the institutional system, instead of building on what was previously done. Even we are late, I think it would be better to make several steps back trying to rearrange the planning and policy making process itself toward a more inclusive and integrated one.  I’m not sure to what extent the Romanian Government is ready to tackle directly the dysfunctional aspects in this respect, but I hope a certain redesign will take place in order to stimulate for real the horizontal and vertical partnerships and associations at territorial, inter-institutional and inter-sectoral level. And I also hope that redesigning process will go in deep – as for example the regionalization – to find the most appropriate way of responsibilities and mirrored resources allocation as to achieve economy of scale along with communities’ active involvement.<br><strong><br>Q: In what way can the NALAS Task Force on Urban Planning support urban development throughout South-East Europe?</strong><br><br><strong>A: </strong>First of all, it is about a kind of fight against the difficulty of being alone climbing mountains… so it is about helping each other by coordinating exchanges to make things happen. And making them happen in the same or similar pace throughout the SEE Region. By disseminating information and outputs, as well as by working together on building creative and innovative approaches to urban development, the learning process is more efficient and our region can better capitalize the learning outcomes.<br><br><strong>Q: How do you see your participation in the NALAS Task Force on Urban Planning? What does this mean to you personally and to your Association? </strong><br><strong><br>A: </strong>I am continuously impressed by the positive energy of the Task Force on Urban Planning members and I try to contribute with my own – definitely stimulated by the group and the information that everyone brings as expert and as representative of his/her Association. We have the opportunity to touch so many interesting and challenging topics – such as data &amp; information systems for planning, land management, social impact of the spatial planning, fiscal policies as tools for urban management, mobility and accessibility, etc. Our interaction and mutual projects makes me understand better the situation in my own country and also helps me to be better equipped to propose future initiatives, in line with the regional “symphony”, to the Romanian Association of Communes which I proudly represent. It is definitely a colour and a sound that makes us evolve.

Of course, this is not enough, this was only a beginning and should be deepened in the future, as practical guide to respond to the needs of municipalities. The second thing is the exchange of practices among different countries. For us, the most important is that this seminar provided a very honest dialogue, exchanging both good and bad practices, what works and what doesn't. And last, but not least, this seminar raised many practical ideas that still need to be initiated and implemented by the Local Government Associations (LGAs) and the municipalities themselves in the EU integration process. So, I see benefits for the LGAs, their members and for NALAS.

The meeting focused on exchange of Associations' and countries' experiences in sustainable tourism and finalization of the Toolkit for Planning Sustainable Tourism at Local Level. <br><br>The members of the Task Force, coming from tourism departments of SEE municipalities or NALAS member LGAs, learned from each other how tourist tax is regulated in each of the counties and what role LGAs have in the area of sustainable tourism development at local level. Also, they discussed concrete project ideas in sustainable tourism to be implemented by the Network. In a workshop format, the Task Force worked on finalizing one of its knowledge products, the Toolkit for Planning Sustainable Tourism at Local Level. This Toolkit will assist municipalities in assessing and organizing around the potential for tourism at a local level, integrating it into official local government planning.<br><br>The event also included a site visit to the eco-village EcoFutura, near Sarajevo. The village, built in the mountains by a group of enthusiasts from a non-governmental organization, in a perfect harmony with the nature, offers homemade vegetarian food, accommodation, team building facilities and kids' playgrounds.     <br><br><a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/110818193078428326398/NALASSustainableTourismTaskForce#\">Photo Gallery</a><br><br><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/ST%20TF4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"302\" height=\"225\"><br><br><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/ST%20TF3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"302\" height=\"225\"></p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-ST-TF1-Sar.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/ST%20TF4.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/ST%20TF3.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-ST-TF1-Sar.jpg", "path": "low-ST-TF1-Sar.jpg", "checksum": "69d746386d19361c6c97a6d107d18712", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-ST-TF1-Sar.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/ST%20TF4.jpg", "path": "ST%20TF4.jpg", "checksum": "3f5139320894b79bfccc0c252da4dfb7", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/cms/Content_Data/Images/ST%20TF4.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/ST%20TF3.jpg", "path": "ST%20TF3.jpg", "checksum": "f0ff86ac0ccc886b5de18515647d2398", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/cms/Content_Data/Images/ST%20TF3.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

The session provided information about what happened during the floods and evaluated the lessons for water services and water utilities. Also, it included key international institutions involved in emergency response and flood prevention. At this session, NALAS presented the solidarity of the Network in providing support to the flooded municipalities, lessons learned from this process, as well as the next steps that the Network plans to implement to address its members' needs in disaster management and preparedness. In the upcoming period, NALAS Task Forces in Urban Planning and Solid Waste and Water Management will take the lead to produce: LGA Manual; List of policy issues relevant to disaster preparedness and management; Draft a NALAS network structure and protocol for acting in emergency situations. Also, NALAS will assist in providing capacity building for LGAs in disaster management.<br><br><img src=\"http://www.nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/Water3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"440\" height=\"329\"><br><br>At the meeting of Danube Water Utility Associations (29 October 2014), during the session on knowledge management, NALAS talked about its work in policy making and capacity building. Also, NALAS Knowledge System was presented, with an accent on possible cooperation with the water utility associations through the Danube Water Program. As concluded from the session, NALAS Knowledge Centre is a great resource that can be used as a model for the water utility associations. Since the provision of quality water services for citizens necessarily includes both local governments and public utilities, NALAS, working with local governments associations and their members, the local governments, can match its expertise with the expertise of water utility associations, which focus on the public utilities. <br><br>In partnership with the Danube Water Program (DWP) and the Open Regional Fund-Modernization of Municipal Services (ORF-MMS), as part of the Regional Dialogue Platform on Water and Waste Water in SEE, a session of the Working Group on Training was organized on 30 October 2014. LGAs and PUAs discussed current developments and challenges in the water sector. DWP presented the progress of their ongoing regional research about the state of the sector. Shukalb, the Association of water utilities from Albania presented the progress of their ongoing research on the framework and business model for regional training network on water and waste water for Western Balkans. They also informed about their recently approved project that will aim to develop 40 training courses in water management, supported by USAID for the period October 2014-October 2017, worth $1.3 million. Mr. Sandi Zulic from Aquasan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, presented NALAS' and Aquasan's efforts in developing a Regional Decentralized Training Facility, while Ms. Alexandra Preis presented GIZ experience in capacity building for the water sector worldwide. Ms. Jelena Janevska presented the activities of the NALAS regional e-Academy, as an invaluable resource for providing high-quality, modern and practical online e-learning courses. <br><br>The Working Group on Training opened important discussions about the structure and organization of future trainings, as well as the issue of exchange, coordination and cooperation among the different stakeholders involved in the water sector.<br><br>On 30 October 2014, a working meeting of the project Local Leaders South East Europe was organized, focusing on providing feedback to the proposed methodology for training needs assessment. This training needs assessment will cover 15 municipalities and their public utilities from 4 countries and will serve as a base for establishing a regional training scheme for developing management capacities in the water sector.<br><br><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/Water2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"441\" height=\"292\"> </p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/Water3.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/Water2.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/Water3.jpg", "path": "Water3.jpg", "checksum": "96a2501565bca0b84785e74de9b63cf2", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/cms/Content_Data/Images/Water3.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/cms/Content_Data/Images/Water2.jpg", "path": "Water2.jpg", "checksum": "a055419e00004f509572659730318918", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/cms/Content_Data/Images/Water2.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

I expect that this conference brings new ideas and opens interesting discussions on what we as Mayors and local governments can do to contribute to making the Sustainable Development Goals our reality. The way we need to undergo requires a strong commitment by all stakeholders, both at local and national level, so we are looking forward to join forces for the benefit of our citizens”</em>, said in his opening address Mr. Mico Micic, President of NALAS and Mayor of Bijeljina, Bosnia and Herzegovina. “SDGs provide a huge potential got local governments to contribute to sustainable development. But, this is only possible if we understand them and take actions”, said Mr. Micic.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Brdo2\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Brdo2.jpg\" alt=\"Brdo2\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Dr. Ute Boettcher from GIZ elaborated one of the core principles of the SDGs, “Leaving no one behind”. <em>“We shall now ask the question how can we reach to the ones that were used to be left behind, considering that it takes money, time and efforts. The three key things are to reach those disadvantaged groups, remove access barriers and creating supporting environment”</em>, said Dr Boettcher. <em>“I am glad to see that in the Balkans region you are way ahead by not only understanding SDGs, but also dedicating this conference to the core principle of “Leaving no one behind”</em>.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Brdo3\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Brdo3.jpg\" alt=\"Brdo3\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Dr. Eva Dick, from the German Development Institute, focused on the relevance of SDGs for the local level, pointing out that 21% of the 169 targets can only be implemented by local actors, while 24% shall be implemented in partnership with them. Dr. Dick elaborated on why SDGs must go local, emphasising that they provide orientation for sustainable and integrated development planning; are a point of departure for monitoring, allow linking to sources of development finance and create a base for inter-sectorial exchange. Dr.Dick also shared best practices in localising SDGs from Germany, from cities like Cologne, Manheim and Bottrop.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Brdo5\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Brdo5.jpg\" alt=\"Brdo5\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The panel discussion: From Theory into practice: Challenges in bringing 2030 agenda and SDGs closer to community level shared various experiences in operationalising SDGs in different municipalities and improving services to vulnerable groups. Ms. Kathleen Depoorter, a Councilor of Evergem Municipality in Belgium spoke about her municipality experiences in implementing SDGs, learning from and exchanging with the municipality Guaranda in Ecuador. <em>“We started from our international cooperation department and widened our SDGs support circle in the municipality. Now we have 17 employees, who, besides other tasks deal with localising SDGs”</em>, said Ms. Depoorter.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Brdo22\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Brdo22.jpg\" alt=\"Brdo22\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Mayor Emanuil Manolov, from Pavlikeni, Bulgaria, presented the social services in Bulgaria and the innovative social services of Pavlikeni.</p>\r\n<p>Mr. Thomas Prorok, from KDZ and the Austrian Association of Cities and Towns talked about the approach of the Austrian Association and Austrian cities and municipalities in localising SDGs. The Association works on developing Guidelines that provide advices and best practices for local governments on localising the SDGs. <em>“The SDGs show how the World will look like in the future, 10-20 years from now, which is a great starting point and compass for all local governments in planning their local actions”</em>, said Mr. Prorok.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Brdo8\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//Brdo8.jpg\" alt=\"Brdo8\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Mr. Ugo Poli, from the Central European Initiative (CEI) spoke about the role of partnerships in addressing local needs. <em>“The issue of partnership is an issue of effectiveness of governance”</em>, said Mr. Poli.</p>\r\n<p>In the afternoon session, using the World Café method, 8 groups discussed various aspects of SDGs implementation at local level and integration of voulnerable groups. The discussion groups focused on scanning the current situation related to Awareness; Advocacy; Implementation and Monitoring.   </p>\r\n<p title=\"Brdo11\"><img

The e-learning course for using TRACE is delivered by the Association of Local Self-Government Units in the Republic of Macedonia (ZELS) and NALAS periodically, and all interested municipalities and participants are invited to contact ZELS and express their interest in the course.</p>\r\n<p>A Guide will be prepared and distributed as a part of the project, which will aim to help local administration (Mayor, municipal council, EE manager, EE administrator etc.) step by step through the process of creation and implementation of efficient and effective energy efficiency program.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-EEMK.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-EEMK.jpg", "path": "low-EEMK.jpg", "checksum": "f9c0918e6371e71637dac7599e0c701c", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-EEMK.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

This means that the most important services to citizens will be now delivered by local governments\"</em>, said <strong>Mr. Enea Hoti, Senior Advisor of the Ministry of Local Issues</strong>. <em>\"Still, fiscal decentralisation is the core of decentralisation and Albania still has a lot to do in this regard.

The workshop discussed common problems, the advantages and disadvantages of different legislative approaches, intergovernmental communications, and other key policy issues and lessons learned from different parts of the SEE region. Representatives of NALAS member LGAs shared their extensive experience with their Albanian peers.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"25% of the total budget of Kosovo go to Kosovo municipalities\"</em>, said <strong>Mr. Sazan Ibrahimi, Director of the Association of Kosovo Municipalities (AKM)</strong>. <em>\"We have a number of own revenue sources, such as Property Tax, taxes on construction permits, land use, business affairs, registration of cars, etc. AKM has a strong partnership with the line Ministries and it never happens that a law concerning municipalities is drafted without the involvement of AKM\"</em>, concluded Mr. Ibrahimi.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Tir5\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir5.jpg\" alt=\"Tir5\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>In the same direction, <strong>Ms. Zana Djukic, the Advisor for Municipal Finances of the Union of Municipalities of Montengero</strong> recommended that in drafting the new Law on Local Finances for Albania measures are foreseen for compensating local governments in the case of legal changes imposed by the central Government that reduce their revenues.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"Municipalities in Macedonia have two important shared taxes: 4,5% of the VAT go to Municipalities, based on three distribution criteria: 1) the number of inhabitants, 2) the number of settlements and 3) the territory of LG.

This is a real, actual decentralisation, where citizens get most of their services directly from Municipalities\"</em>, said <strong>Ms. Dushica Perishic, Executive Director of the Association of Units of Local Self-Government of the Republic of Macedonia (ZELS)</strong>.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Tir8\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir8.jpg\" alt=\"Tir8\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>As local borrowing is currently not possible in Albania, while it can be an important investment mechanism, a session of the workshop explored SEE countries' experiences in this area. A Deputy Mayor and finance experts from <strong>Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro</strong> elaborated the allocation of conditional grants in those countries, as well as debt capital and investments at local level. <em>\"In the Republic of Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the law allows indebtedness of 18% of municipality's regular revenues. Many municipalities use local borrowing to ensure important local investments\"</em>, explained <strong>Ms. Dijana Coric, Municipal Fianance Advisor from the Association of Towns and Municipalities of the Republic of Srpska</strong>.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Tir9\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir9.jpg\" alt=\"Tir9\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The workshop developed strategic options and recommendations to help ensure the financial sustainability of local governments in Albania.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//Tir4.jpg\" alt=\"Tir4\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>During the <strong>second day</strong> of the event, to help their peers from Albania in designing the an effective <strong>local budgeting process</strong>, Municipal Finance Officers from <strong>Banja Luka</strong> (Bosnia and Herzegovina), <strong>Podgorica</strong> (Montenegro) and <strong>Istog</strong> (Kosovo) explained the budgeting processes in their countries and cities and provided practical advices that can help Albanian central and local authorities.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"The head of the budget department is obliged to establish a municipal team for defining municipal priorities for the budget year, made of the heads of all municipal departments. It is an element of the budgeting process which includes extensive internal consultations in parallel with the public hearings for the municipal budget\"</em>, explained <strong>Mr. Osman Sadikaj, Head of the Budget Department of Istog</strong>, Kosovo and member of NALAS Task Force in Fiscal Decentralisation.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Tir10\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir10.jpg\" alt=\"Tir10\" width=\"209\" height=\"158\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>Mr. Miomir Jaksic, Head of the Finance Department of Podgorica</strong>, Montenegro, shared one of the best practices of the Capital of Montenegro when it comes to preparing the municipal budget. In the process of developing the 2016 budget, the City of Podgorica cooperated with the civil society sector. Namely, a civil society organisation made a survey among all the 15 neighbourhood units of the City and submitted the findings and priorities to the city. 70% of them were incorporated in the City budget.</p>\r\n<p>In the <strong>panel: Rules Governing Intergovernmental Dialogue</strong>, the Moderator, <strong>Mr. Agron Haxhimali, the Executive Director of AA</strong>M, invited his colleagues to provide advice to the Albanian Associations of Local Authorities on how to approach the negotiations for the Law on Local Government Finance in Albania.</p>\r\n<p>On the level of Government and Ministries, the National Association of Municipalities in the Republic of Bulgaria (NAMRB) is represented in over 150 working groups in various legislative processes in Bulgaria. Fiscal decentralisation and management of EU funds are the main topics NAMRB is discussing with the Bulgarian Parliament. <em>\"I recommend that, no matter how difficult it is, the LGAs in Albania make sure that there are no “winners and losers” among the municipalities as a result of the legislation that is negotiated. This will create unity and strong position in front of the central government\"</em>, advised <strong>Mr. Emil Savov, the Deputy Executive Director of NAMRB</strong>.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Tir13\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir13.jpg\" alt=\"Tir13\" width=\"207\" height=\"155\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>Ms. Dusica Perisic, the Executive Director ZELS</strong> emphasised that one of the most utilised instruments for lobbying for ZELS is the Intergovernmental Commission for Municipal Finances where ZELS has five members, while the Ministries have four members. The role of this Commission is to follow what kind of distribution of the funds will take place in the next year – on the grants, on VAT, education, culture, etc. <em>\"These Commissions discuss the formulas and change them as needed, as we did seven years ago with the VAT redistribution in favour of rural municipalities\"</em>, explained Ms. Perisic.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mr. Refik Bojadzic, the General Secretary of the Union of Municipalities of Montenegro</strong> explained that the Union has a very important role in the distribution of the money from the Equalisation Fund, which is a widely used instrument in Montenegro. There is a Commission on Fiscal Equalisation consisted of seven Mayors and two Ministers, of Finance and Local Government, and practically the Union has highest responsibility for allocation of this Fund.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Tir14\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//Tir14.jpg\" alt=\"Tir14\" width=\"204\" height=\"154\"></p>\r\n<p>In the concluding Panel: Key Conditions for an Effective Local Finance Laws, <strong>the International Finance Expert Mr. Tony Levitas</strong> made a review of the recommendations conveyed by NALAS members during the two days. The key message is that the future local finance system of Albania should focus less on expanding conditional funds and more on increasing the general amount of revenues through the general grant. The event was concluded with final messages of the USAID Mission Director to Albania, the Mayor of Tirana, the Vice President of NALAS Mr. Mico Micic, the Executive Director of AAM Mr. Agron Haxhimali and representatives of the Ministries of Finance and Local Government of Albania.</p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Tir1.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir2.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir3.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir5.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir6.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir7.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir8.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir9.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir4.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir10.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir13.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir14.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Tir1.jpg", "path": "low-Tir1.jpg", "checksum": "4aab5bc52eca1b66ed4ab0321a55e280", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-Tir1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir2.jpg", "path": "Tir2.jpg", "checksum": "3818720e7fb9b657e55ebd7d28447f8f", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Tir2.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir3.jpg", "path": "Tir3.jpg", "checksum": "b0caa17b365184d531ded7ca0b3679c3", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Tir3.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir5.jpg", "path": "Tir5.jpg", "checksum": "83c66db0826c0686cbf11eaad88aeffe", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Tir5.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir6.jpg", "path": "Tir6.jpg", "checksum": "6c9577c2b196f453fc48e181e752db38", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Tir6.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir7.jpg", "path": "Tir7.jpg", "checksum": "4279fbce8a1892fd400498d8f6ff10cd", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Tir7.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir8.jpg", "path": "Tir8.jpg", "checksum": "8915a3600ee1016d72f9e20ad49d8d46", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Tir8.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir9.jpg", "path": "Tir9.jpg", "checksum": "991400ebbf654090704abca45662be06", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Tir9.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir4.jpg", "path": "Tir4.jpg", "checksum": "9856001b13921f02b6d7e5ab08ef62f7", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Tir4.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir10.jpg", "path": "Tir10.jpg", "checksum": "fe03aea0d4fd428e4ec811a84810e713", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Tir10.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir13.jpg", "path": "Tir13.jpg", "checksum": "cb1f2635c8ffe159a1e0f013eeebd946", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Tir13.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Tir14.jpg", "path": "Tir14.jpg", "checksum": "61460f828f115f3156b6334fac326d21", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Tir14.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

You do a great job with the annual Fiscal Decentralization Indicators Report\"</em>, said Mr. Mehmeti. <em>\"NALAS Task Forces are very important part of NALAS work and the Fiscal Decentralization Task Force is one of the most active\"</em>, added Mr. Samec. <em>\"Capacity building for this group is very important and we are happy to support it\"</em>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mr. Riël Franzsen</strong>, a renowned expert in property taxation, scholar and writer was the Instructor of the 2015 Summer School, bringing a wide experience of property tax management in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Caribbean.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"Property Tax is called the most hated tax, maybe because it is there, in your face, all the time, on annual basis\"</em>, says Mr. Franzsen. <em>\"It taxes unearned income, is highly political, cumbersome to maintain and with high administration costs\"</em>, explains the Summer School Instructor.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Fouth pic\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Fourth_pic.jpg\" alt=\"Fouth pic\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #003366;\"><strong>Day 1 of the Second NALAS Summer School</strong></span> on Local Governance and Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations started by exploring Property Tax from the historical, comparative and political perspective. Property Tax is one of the most important municipal own source revenues, contributing to the fiscal autonomy of local government, emphasized the participants and the Instructor. Unfortunately, its successful implementation is often hindered by number of political and administration factors.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"Policy is only good if it can be properly administered. This is often a problem with the Property Tax\"</em>, said Mr. Franzsen. Therefore, Summer School sessions explored the Property Taxation Cycle, including: property discovery and registration; assessment and valuation; rate setting; tax relief; billing; collection; enforcement; and ongoing system management. Also, participants discussed municipal strategies for improving Property Tax collection.</p>\r\n<p title=\"SS fifth pic\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//SS-5.jpg\" alt=\"SS fifth pic\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The annual NALAS Fiscal Decentralization Indicators Report is showing that there is a trend of increasing Property Tax collection rate in Macedonian municipalities. <strong>Ms. Dusica Perisic</strong>, the Director of the Union of Local Self-Governments in the Republic of Macedonia (ZELS) presented the ten years of property taxation reforms in Macedonia. She explained the role of ZELS in supporting the municipalities in Macedonia in administering Property Tax, from providing a database to strengthening their human capacities. <em>\"As a result of these efforts, since 2006 we have a positive trend of Property Tax collection every year. Our champion, the Municipality of Bogovinje, has tripled the collected amount since 2011\"</em>, emphasized Perisic.</p>\r\n<p title=\"SS Sixth pic\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//SS_Sixth_Pic.jpg\" alt=\"SS Sixth pic\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The last session of Day 1 of the Second NALAS Summer School on Local Governance and Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations explored Property Transfer Tax. It provided a brief international overview, explained the nature and types of transfer taxes and international trends, as well as policy options and administrative issues.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #003366;\"><strong>Day 2 of the Second NALAS Summer School </strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">on Local Governance and Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations</span></span> focused on mapping the tax base for Property Tax. Through a group work, participants mapped the objects of taxation, taxpayers and institutions responsible for tax payment in SEE. Also, they mapped Property Tax \"upstream\" and \"downstream\" functions across levels of Government, discussing the pros and cons of centrally-maintained fiscal cadastres, and the process of valuation of property. Property Tax functions across levels of government were discussed, related to tax rates, maintenance of billing lists, collection system, fines and penalties, tax reliefs, enforcement mechanisms, etc.</p>\r\n<p>In an interesting session, <strong>Mr. Visar Zekaj</strong>, from the DEMOS Program in Kosovo presented the experience of DEMOS in incentivizing local property tax collection in Kosovo municipalities. Mr. Zekaj explained their performance management system in the area of Property Tax collection, the base lines defined, the sanctions and rewards system and the lessons from the field.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"DEMOS Program works to help decentralizing the system and improving the services of municipalities\"</em>, says Mr. Zekaj.<em> \"We work with 17 out of 38 municipalities in Kosovo, providing technical assistance and quite unique system of performance-based grants. The final results are yet to be seen, but the trend is very positive, the Property Tax collection rate is increasing\". </em></p>\r\n<p title=\"Visar\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Visar.jpg\" alt=\"Visar\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #003366;\"><strong>The last, third day of </strong><strong>the Second </strong><strong>NALAS Summer School</strong></span> on Local Governance and Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations started with a Peer Review Session on the Property Taxation Reforms in Bulgaria. <strong>Ms. Sia Shehtanova</strong>, Deputy Mayor of Samokov, on behalf of the National Association of Municipalities in the Republic of Bulgaria (NAMRB) presented the Bulgarian experiences and initiatives for changes in local taxation.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"We are proposing expanding the taxation on property, to include agricultural lands and forests, state and municipal public property and schools\"</em>, explained Ms. Shehtanova. <em>\"Also, Municipal Councils have to have a say in determining the tax base, not only tax rate. We would like local communities to have more right to define local fiscal policy\". </em></p>\r\n<p title=\"Sia1\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Sia1.jpg\" alt=\"Sia1\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>In a vivid discussion after Mr. Shehtanova's presentation, participants discussed very important issues, such as: the impact of new policies on the collection rate, possible negative influence on the agriculture sector, relations with the central government, etc.</p>\r\n<p>The round-table discussion: <em>Citizen Participation and Municipal Transparency as supporting factors for property taxation</em> focused on two questions:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>How can local governments communicate with citizens in respect of the different phases of property tax cycle?</li>\r\n<li>Existing initiatives for increasing transparency and accountability in property taxation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Participants shared their experiences in citizen participation in budgeting and taxation issues, such as: participative budgeting (Albania, Macedonia), public meetings, hearings, forums and discussions (Montenegro, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Slovenia, Macedonia, Kosovo), public awareness and outreach campaigns (Serbia, Albania, Macedonia, Slovenia), citizens advisory panels (Albania), performance-based budgeting (Turkey), etc.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Svetle\"><img src=\"http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Svetle.jpg\" alt=\"Svetle\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Still, most of the participants emphasized that citizens participation is not taken seriously by politicians, nor systematically structured from administrative point of view. Therefore, in the reality of local communities it is more theoretical and declarative (legislative) than practical, and often forced by donors. <em>\"We have to look into the issue of citizens participation in parallel with the process of fiscal decentralization. In my country, communes come to a point that they don't have any money (budget) to discuss with citizens. What is the point of public discussion of a budget that is enough only for paying utilities?\"</em>, said in the discussion <strong>Mr. Viorel Furdui</strong>, the Director of the Congress of Local Authorities in Moldova (CALM).</p>\r\n<p>Mr. Riël Franzsen, the Summer School Instructor, shared examples of public awareness campaigns around the world that helped local governments successfully implement tax reforms, even when they were painful for the citizens. \"<em>It is key to convey to the citizens how the new tax will contribute to improving their lives\"</em>, said Mr. Franzsen.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Seventh pic\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//SeventhSS.jpg\" alt=\"Seventh pic\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The session on Enforcement Mechanisms and Strategies elaborated various strategies for property taxation, such as billing and collection through utilities, online tax calculator, self-assessment and online payment, strategic enforcement and public relations.</p>\r\n<p>In the last session, the Fiscal Decentralization Task Force discussed the plan for developing the new Fiscal Decentralization Indicators Report, which will this time, with the support of UN Women, be enhanced with gender responsive budget indicators. <strong>Ms. Ivona Bisevac </strong>and<strong> Ms. Sanela Skrijelj</strong> from UN Women office in Macedonia joined the group, presented the gender indicators that will be included in the new report and got the consent of the Task Force for collecting the data.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Nate\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Nate.jpg\" alt=\"Nate\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p title=\"UNWomen\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//UNWomen.jpg\" alt=\"UNWomen\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>At the end of the Summer School, participants received certificates of participation. In their evaluations of the Summer School, participants expressed highest satisfaction. In their opinion, the Summer School was very useful, helping them learn all the details about Property Tax, in the whole world, but also exchange with colleagues from South-East Europe and compare performances.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"The Summer School was very useful since Property Tax is one of the most important aspects of local finances\"</em>, said <strong>Ms. Dunja Naic</strong>, a member of the NALAS Fiscal Decentralization Task Force from the Standing Conference of Towns and Municipalities in the Republic of Serbia (SCTM).<em> \"The Instructor was a very renowned expert with huge international experience, and was able to give very useful advices. Also, sharing experiences with colleagues from other countries was indispensable</em><em>\", concludes Ms. Naic</em>. </p>\r\n<p>We were happy to serve our members.

Calls to rethink the European project dominated the plenary, with participants in the panel debate suggesting that a new practice of local and European policy will re-invigorate a desire for Europe that “has dried up”.</p>\r\n<p>Mr. Zajazi reminded that in the time of crisis following the break-up of the Soviet Union, “<em>the attitude of states was to close and centralise</em>”. Despite the fact that in South East Europe most challenges are magnified, with a decline in quality of governance, and a deterioration in public trust, “<em>citizens have not lost hope</em>” and “<em>a federal union can save Europe</em>”.</p>\r\n<p>CEMR secretary general, Frédéric Vallier, introduced CEMR’s project to prepare a bluebook with towns and regions’ suggestions to reinvent a Europe that will be able to face current challenges, including radicalism, unemployment, environmental problems or gender equality, to name a few. “<em>In 1945 no one would have believed that the European project would come true, we shouldn’t underestimate our capacities to reinvigorate Europe</em>.”</p>\r\n<p>On their part, the Mayor of Fontainebleau and Coordinator of Debating Europe 2030 Frédéric Valletoux called “<em>for a new practice of local and European policy</em>”, while the President of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe, Jean-Claude Frécon, “<em>called for a renewal of politics, a renewal of public life actors and a renewal of hope</em>”.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Kel2\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Kel2.jpg\" alt=\"Kel2\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The Member of the European Parliament, Jan Olbrycht called on mayors to take part in the future of Europe, but pointed out that the reality of Europe may be completely different in a few months, should the referendum yield a Brexit vote. While recognising that proximity to citizens entails more responsibility for local governments, there was also a frank assessment that there are many mayors and citizens that are becoming increasingly anti-European, but he suggested that “<em>local government has to rethink Europe because all the decisions taken at EU level are implemented at the local level</em>”.</p>\r\n<p>At the end of an intensive three-day conversation, the debate panelists discussed challenges that are not unique to Europe, but which transcend continents and borders. The Mayor of Johannesburg, Mpho Parks Tau, suggested that “<em>government is not something that is static… it needs to adapt to changing conditions, and we must never say that we have mastered the art of governance</em>”. He went on to point out that “<em>local authorities must go beyond [geopolitics], and build on the capacity of their members</em>” to find solutions to common problems.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Kel1.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Kel2.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Kel1.jpg", "path": "low-Kel1.jpg", "checksum": "f6b0397d2208423f8e647b1e9a5c5d59", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-Kel1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Kel2.jpg", "path": "Kel2.jpg", "checksum": "74682ba18bb5d1630629f99432b0ac82", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Kel2.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

This Report is an ongoing effort to provide policy-makers and analysts with reliable comparative data on municipal finances and intergovernmental fiscal relations in South-East Europe. As decentralisation is one of the key issues of concern of NALAS' members and SEE local governments, we are ready to go step forward, in establishing NALAS Decentralisation Observatory.</p>\r\n<p>With the project <em>\"Towards SEE Decentralisation Observatory\"</em>, financed by “Support to the implementation of the SEE 2020 Strategy” programme of the Regional Cooperation Council, NALAS aims towards improvement of the application of the Subsidiarity principle in delivery of public services in SEE as per the standards of the European Charter of Local Self Government. The project will put in place conditions for decision-making towards establishment of a “SEE Decentralisation Observatory” and therefore strengthen NALAS as a regional dimension coordinator of the Pillar “Governance for Growth” of the SEE2020 Strategy. The action will result into a concept and methodology for establishment of the “SEE Decentralisation Observatory” and raised awareness for the need of such activity in the region.</p>\r\n<p>The activities to be implemented involve: Desk research on the current practices in regional monitoring of the decentralisation process in SEE; Field research in all beneficiary economies on the national monitoring systems related to the decentralisation process; Regional workshop for development of methodology for the set-up of the Decentralisation Observatory based on the findings of  the research; Preparation of a study/report with recommendations for future steps towards  setting up of the “SEE Decentralisation Observatory”; and Dissemination of the findings and recommendations of the study.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><em>Until 8 August 2016, NALAS has an open call for international, regional, and national experts.

The Agenda takes the form of a covenant for the global future, designed to help everyone in the world enjoy a dignified life. It is interesting that the 2030 Agenda was conceived in the spirit of a new global partnership – all divisions into 'donors' and 'recipients' or 'first', 'second' and 'third world' are superseded by the notion of shared responsibility for the humankind and the planet.</p>\r\n<p>The project began by an analysis of current links of German and municipalities in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe (Albania, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Moldova and Serbia), which showed that approximately 80% of the German municipalities surveyed that have links with the region through municipal partnerships, expressed interest to workg together with their partners on the SDGs. 70% of the German municipalities would also like to deepen the cooperation with their partner municipality. The Municipal Partnerships for Sustainability enables them to do both.  </p>\r\n<p>The core activity of the project is an upgrade of the current relations of “sister municipalities” between Germany and SEE, with design of joint activities that go into direction of achieving the SDGs at the local level. The specific objectives are: to establish a dialogue on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within their municipal partnerships, build strategic cooperation to achieve them and strengthen partnerships between German municipalities and municipalities in SEE by supporting a jointly designed action.</p>\r\n<p>A kick off workshop took place in Bonn in September, following to which municipal representatives visited their sister municipalities and jointly worked on development of a project idea and exchange of knowledge.

This observation corresponds also to the enlargement process itself.

Dr. Schausberger assured his support to bring the expressed NALAS concerns to the attention of Commissioner Hahn and his cabinet.

The constant developments in Europe and globally are fast and unpredictable. The Brexit challenged the very existence of the European project, but luckily the most recent outcomes of elections in Netherlands and France give the hope that our continent has the strength to go forward towards prosperity and a brighter common future.  Unfortunately, in this wider fragile context, the Balkans lost the attention it had in the past two decades and especially decentralisation fall down on the priority list of our countries and the European traditional supporters. Suddenly all major counterparts forgot how important is the decentralisation in the Balkans in building the peace, stability and economic prosperity. However, the associations and their members – the local authorities in South East Europe – undoubtly continued to be active participants and contributors in strengthening important regional initiatives and achievement of strategic goals that, we hope, will strengthen and intensify their role in the region, and will move forward up the agenda of local governance and local democracy. We come today to you with a proposal for a new Strategic Plan of NALAS for the next 5 years’ period. This strategy is built being fully aware of the current challenges, the fragile environment and scarcity of resources. Yet it brings new innovative ideas and sets very ambitious targets”</em>, said Mr. Ismajli.</p>\r\n<p title=\"GAVienna9\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//GAVienna9.jpg\" alt=\"GAVienna9\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Ms. Breda Pecan, the Vice President of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe, emphasised the important role NALAS plays: <em>“</em><em>NALAS has been, and continues to be, very important to the Congress. Important because we see you as a success story, a shining example of what can be done, a beacon of hope in a region that has known more than its fair share of problems and conflicts, and which is considered as “fragile”, as stressed by the EU Council at its summit in March this year. It is important too, because you bring together the national associations of local and regional authorities in the region; and these associations are our most essential and genuine partners for promoting and implementing European standards and policies for local democracy, and thereby improving the lives of our citizens. NALAS is recognised for the high quality of its work, for its networking capacity, and for the spirit of co-operation it maintains in the region and with its partners. The work done to support its members, and the services it provides to them, are further tangible evidence of its success”</em>, said Mr. Pecan.</p>\r\n<p title=\"GAVienna3\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//GAVienna3.jpg\" alt=\"GAVienna3\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><em>“I am delighted to be with you and I do bring the best greetings of Commissioner Johannes Hahn”</em>, said in his opening speech Dr. Franz Schausberger, Special Advisor to Commissioner Hahn. <em>“In all the ongoing processes the local and regional authorities are playing a key role, even though there is no separate chapter on the subject of the aquis, nor any established EU model for decentralisation, regionalisation and multi-level governance. The role of local and regional authorities in the overall enlargement information strategy is very important because broad public support for enlargement is only achievable if the potential benefits of enlargement are explained to society at grassroots level. To be successful in these efforts we need the local authorities, first and foremost the mayors”</em>.</p>\r\n<p title=\"ViennaGA1\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//ViennaGA1.jpg\" alt=\"ViennaGA1\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Dr. Schausberger emphasised that local governments’ capacities in the legislative, financial and administrative sphere have to be further developed. <em>“Your new book that I just got this morning, the latest Fiscal Decentralisation Report for South-East Europe is a great basis for doing this, also very useful for us, and I thank you for doing this study”</em>, said Dr. Schausberger.</p>\r\n<p>Two important policy positions were voiced by the General Assembly, one on the Western Balkans in the EU enlargement agenda and the Local Governments and their Associations as key stakeholders in the EU Integration process, and the second one on responding to the need for capacity development for the water and sanitation sector in South-East Europe.</p>\r\n<p>Mayor Darko Fras, NALAS Vice President presented the NALAS <strong>Position Paper “Western Balkans in the loop, Local Governments and their Associations as key stakeholders in the EU Integration Process”</strong>.</p>\r\n<p title=\"GAVienna4\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//GAVienna4.jpg\" alt=\"GAVienna4\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><em>“EU is about people, for people and around people. The location where people live, act, meet and liaise directly with government and public administration is the local level! A functional bottom-up approach depends on an effective coordination and cooperation between local and central government level to be successful”</em>, states the Position Paper. The position paper puts forward several proposals for dialogue facilitation, such as: EU Commission - Technical or administrative unit for LGAs and LGs to address to, European Parliament Working Group, Western Balkans Cooperation Days, and suggestions for EU support instruments that will increase involvement of Local Governments and their Associations.</p>\r\n<p>The delegates of the NALAS General Assembly reviewed Network’s work in 2016 and the work plan for 2017, and discussed and approved the new <strong>Strategic Plan of the Network for the period 2018-2022</strong>. The new strategy will focus on supporting LGAs and LGs in sustainable local economic development, smart and innovative growth, job creation and community resilience and regional cohesion.</p>\r\n<p>Based on the rotation presidency system, Mr. Mico Micic, Mayor of Bijeljina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, assumed the role of NALAS President, who will lead the Network in the next year.

As you know our partnership with IAWD is a strategic one and for that purpose we have signed a Memorandum of Understanding a year ago. We are not just about to start a new big program called RCDN with a value of almost 7 million Euro with the main purpose to create a capacity building offer specialised in increasing capacities of our municipal staff to be able to plan and manage infrastructure projects in water and other sectors.

Having more than 70 participants, the session demonstrated part of the training in Efficient organisation and effective management of communal services, one of the five trainings developed within the program “Local Leaders South East Europe: Lead for Change” (LL SEE), implemented in the past two years with the support of GIZ. The session, focused on practical approaches and tools for local decision-makers for planning investments and improving water supply and sanitation services, attracted great interest of the audience and high interaction.

Often, it is requested by financing institutions.</li>\r\n<li>FOPIP identifies the key management areas for improvement in the company;</li>\r\n<li>It is essential that local governments and public utility companies work together in all phases, from the assessment, determining the indicators, setting objectives, planning and implementing actions to improve water and sanitation services;</li>\r\n<li>In doing so, Public Service Agreement is an instrumental tool for setting objectives, determining actions, rights and obligations and monitoring the progress.</li>\r\n<li>In these processes, customers must not be forgotten and their opinions have to be taken into consideration.</li>\r\n<li>Some of the key indicators that the participants thought are the most important to be included in the Public Service Agreement are: quality of service of water, non-revenue water and financial efficiency.</li>\r\n<li>Still, the Public Service Agreement needs to be adjusted to the context. For example, setting these indicators might be challenging in rural areas, where data is lacking.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition to the session hosted by NALAS, Mayors and member LGAs’ representatives addressed in various workshops and plenary sessions during the two-day program of the conference.</p>\r\n<p>Mr. Cemil Arslan, the Secretary General of the Marmara Municipalities Union, Turkey, had quite motivating ignite presentation during the session on Innovative Financing Mechanisms. <em>“</em><em>46% of Istanbul's budget goes to investments, while 99% of its waste water is under control and water loses are cut to a minimum</em>”, said Mr. Arslan.</p>\r\n<p title=\"dwc7\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//dwc7.JPG\" alt=\"dwc7\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Mayor Tatiana Badan, who is also a President of CALM from Moldova, talked in the session on Addressing the challenge of water and sanitation services provision in rural areas. <em>“Although 50% of the population in Moldova lives in rural areas, all central government's development efforts go to urban areas.

{"parent_url": "http://www.nalas.eu/news/?page=16", "url": "http://www.nalas.eu/News/FD_2018", "title": "2018 NALAS’ Fiscal Decentralisation Report: Local services are exacerbated by the deterioration of local finance arrangements ", "article_index": 155, "published_on": "29.01.2019", "body": "<div class=\"description col-md-12\">\r\n                <p>This is the seventh edition of the Report which is an ongoing effort of NALAS’ Fiscal Decentralisation Task Force to provide policy–makers and analysts with reliable comparative data on municipal finances and up to date information on intergovernmental fiscal relations in South–East Europe.</p>\r\n<p>The report is structured in four sections. The first reviews the data used in the report and discusses some basic methodological issues. The second provides an overview of the structure and functions of municipal governments in the region. The third section examines selected indicators of macro–economic performance and fiscal decentralisation. The fourth one focuses on the evolution of intergovernmental finances in each NALAS’ member country or entity.</p>\r\n<p>The main findings of the Report are the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>There is an ongoing tendency of concentration of people in capital and metropolitan cities, despite the region’s diversity in terms of territorial organization. </strong>In Albania, Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro over 20% of the population lives in the capital cities, which creates significant pressures and challenges for improved service delivery and intergovernmental finance systems.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Local government challenges to provide better services and improve the quality of life of citizens are exacerbated by a general stagnation or deterioration of local finance arrangements </strong>that are not able to keep up or quickly respond to local government needs and developments.</li>\r\n<li>While it is difficult to judge the adequacy of local government revenues relative to their expenditure needs, there seems little question that <strong>in many places in the region municipalities are underfunded, and central governments are not giving them a fair share of the overall fiscal pie</strong>. On average, in 2017, SEE local government revenue as a share of GDP stood at 5.9%, almost half of their counterparts in the EU that benefit from an average of 10.7%.</li>\r\n<li><strong>The level of local fiscal autonomy is decreasing in many SEE countries</strong>. On average local government revenues in SEE decreased by 0.5% between 2015 and 2017, both as a percent of the GDP and Total Public Revenues. Further, compared to 2006, NALAS’s baseline year, the <strong>share of revenues over which local governments can exercise independent decision-making has decreased, </strong>while the share of conditional block grants and specific-purpose investment grants has increased by 50% and 30% respectively.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Local government powers to</strong> <strong>set and collect taxes, fees and charges are in continuous change </strong>– sometimes without a due process of consultation and/or compensation, under the general expectations of improved business climate and relieved fiscal burdens to taxpayers that would result in more job-creation. Unfortunately, this depresses local governments efforts too.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Regardless of level of development and membership to the EU, SEE local governments continue to face similar challenges as regards to own revenue generation</strong>, including the frequent and continuous amendment of the legal framework; outdated fiscal registers; weak tax compliance and enforcement, while commitment of policymakers to make local taxation effective is critical everywhere in the region.</li>\r\n<li>Additionally,<strong> there seems to be an inverse relationship between the level of decentralisation measured by the scope of the social functions devolved to the local governments and the size of the public sector</strong>. The data suggests that surprisingly decentralisation has gone furthest in places where the overall public sector is relatively small, and to minor extent where potentially national governments face significant trouble collecting taxes.</li>\r\n<li><strong>The functional allocation of expenditures shows that SEE local governments spend most of their budgets on Education</strong> and <strong>Housing and Community Amenities:</strong> Education takes 40-60% of municipal budgets in Moldova, Slovenia, Kosovo and Bulgaria - which is 2-3 times more than the EU28 average. In Albania, Croatia and Turkey, local governments spend one quarter to one third of all expenditures on housing and community amenities. <strong>Environmental protection is the function where almost all SEE countries spend the least</strong>.</li>\r\n<li><strong>SEE local governments spend, on average, a third of their budgets on personnel wages/salaries costs</strong> which is almost equal to the EU and<strong>, while the share of spending for capital investments is, on average, twice as much as their counterparts in the EU</strong>. The report provides a comprehensive analysis of the spending patterns of SEE as a region and individual countries, including historic data from 2006, both as a percent of the total, in million Euro or in Euro per capita.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition to providing information on the status and development of the intergovernmental finance systems in SEE, this edition puts more emphasis on service responsibilities of local governments and their revenue raising capacities, identifying the major developments and challenges faced by local governments as regards to the collection of local taxes, fees and charges.</p>\r\n<p>The report publishes for the first time the allocation of local expenditures according to the Classification of the Functions of Government Methodology (COFOG)<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a>, showing not only what SEE local governments do but also what their spending priorities are. Additionally, the report, for the first time includes data in terms of <em>millions of euro</em> and <em>in Euro per capita terms</em>, which will certainly be of help for analysts, practitioners and policymakers to better understand the situation in each country and prepare their own even more detailed analysis.</p>\r\n<p>For downloading the full Report:</p>\r\n<p title=\"2018 Fiscal Decentralisation Report\"><a href=\"http://nalas.eu/Home/Download/FD_rep2018x\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> 2018 Fiscal Decentralisation Report</a></p>\r\n<p title=\"2018 Fiscal Decentralisation Report\"> </p>\r\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a> The <strong>Classification of the functions of government (COFOG)</strong> was developed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and published by the United Nations Statistical Division as a standard classifying the purposes of government activities around the world.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-FDR1.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": ["http://nalas.eu/Home/Download/FD_rep2018x"], "files": [{"url": "http://nalas.eu/Home/Download/FD_rep2018x", "path": "FD_rep2018x", "checksum": "4e3736356c6711c43d1b79b266e0867c", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Home/Download/FD_rep2018x"}], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-FDR1.jpg", "path": "low-FDR1.jpg", "checksum": "9438b9516b630a64b2a72211abd264dd", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-FDR1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

The need for municipalities and Public Utility Companies (PUCs) to undertake efforts in order to provide services as efficient and affordable as possible is therefore clear. In order to improve service levels in municipal waste management policy at the local level, efficiency and quality must be enhanced under the umbrella of an affordable tariff structure. This makes continual analysis and planning essential. Service level evaluation, performance indicator comparison and planning needs require the development of standardized solid waste management calculation tools based on up-to-date information. The harmonisation of the information required for processing and comparison purposes is crucial, and is mirrored in the needs of waste management information tools. It is commonly recognized that solid waste management in South East Europe is weakened by the lack of reliable data at local, institutional and national level. The SWIS model is a tool designed for municipal waste management data collection and analysis and is intended for use by public entities in charge for the provision of this service. It will help local governments to collect and process relevant data on the most important questions in municipal waste management.</p>\r\n<p><a

The meeting focused on the project workplan, research planning and annual plan of secondments.</p>\r\n<p>LoGov aims to provide best fit practices for local governments to address the changing urban rural interplay and manage its impacts. These practices are meant to cater to the specific needs of local government and to be easily applicable.</p>\r\n<p>LoGov fosters a “shared culture of research and innovation” that transcends the boundaries of disciplines, continents and sectors. Three outstanding features ensure that the project generates creative ideas and turns them into innovative approaches that are adaptable to different contexts. First, the consortium brings together knowledge on local government from four different disciplines (law, political science, economics and public administration) which enhances the sharing of knowledge between them and therefore gives a more holistic picture of local government in the context of changing urban-rural relations than the “state of the art” so far.

The Summer School in details explored the Municipal Finances Self-Assessment Tool, developed by the World Bank, as an analytical tool for support of multiannual budgeting and investment as well as performance management.</p>\r\n<p title=\"3SS_6\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//3SS_6.jpg\" alt=\"3SS_6\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Mr. Mehmet Onur Partal, expert of the Istanbul Development Agency, in the first session explored the good governance, public policy development, public management and capital investment planning. <em>\"</em><em>People should be able to follow and understand the decision-making process</em><em>\"</em>, appealed Mr. Partal, referring to the good governance principles.  </p>\r\n<p title=\"3SS_5\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//3SS_5.jpg\" alt=\"3SS_5\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>In the second session, Mr. Partal discussed the alignment of local strategies, budget and capital investments, in the view of smart growth. He explored the process of local strategic planning and prioritising long-term investment needs with local government sectoral policies. <em>\"How many of us know the vision of our cities?\"</em>, asked Mr. Partal. <em>\"Not many, if any. But a vision accepted and shared by the community guarantees the relevance of the strategy and ensures support to its implementation by the citizens\"</em>, said Mr. Partal.    </p>\r\n<p>Gjorgji Josifov, Assistant Vice President/Analyst of Moody's illustrated the role of municipal infrastructure investments contributing to sustainable economic growth by elaborating the cases of the Czech Republic and Poland. EU capital transfers will be the main funding source for local governments' projects beyond 2015, while the co-funding of EU projects will not exert much pressure on their budgets, informed Josifov.</p>\r\n<p title=\"3SS_7\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//3SS_7.jpg\" alt=\"3SS_7\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>During Day 2 of the Summer School, Onur Partal explored methods and tools for revenue and expenditure forecasting for local budgets and raised ideas on how local governments can increase awareness in investment planning and funding. Participants reflected on their experiences in creating local budgets, as well as the revenue generation, including local borrowing.  </p>\r\n<p>The cases of the cities of Zagreb and Istanbul were presented by Gjorgji Josofov and Onur Partal, illustrating the investment planning and funding.</p>\r\n<p title=\"3SS_9\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//3SS_9.jpg\" alt=\"3SS_9\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p title=\"3SS_10\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//3SS_10.jpg\" alt=\"3SS_10\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>In the session on municipal infrastructure investments contributing to sustainable economic growth, Gjorgji Josifov presented case studies from Poland and Czech Republic, explaining how Polish and Czech cities manage big investment projects.

The MFSA tool was presented by Mihaly Kopanyi, Municipal Finance Advisor, World Bank retiree with 23 years of Bank carrier. <em>\"I have two key messages\"</em>, said Mr. Kopanyi. <em>\"First, MFSA looks at your municipality as banks, investors and creditors do. Second, MFSA and UA are the most powerful when they are used together.

Pilot municipalities presented the situation in their LGs and how those can be translated into national policy arguments, while the experts commented the findings.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"I see a big relation between the tools discussed and the fiscal decentralisation\"</em>, said in the discussion Viorel Furdui, Executive Director of the NALAS member LGA, the Congress of Local Authorities from Moldova (CALM). <em>\"In many of our countries, we face policies that urge further centralisation. We all have to work together to promote the fiscal decentralisation, by using different tools, as well as our negotiation capacity\"</em>.   </p>\r\n<p title=\"SS3_18\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//SS3_18.jpg\" alt=\"SS3_18\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The session \"The stories of the data\", by Mihaly Kopanyi focused on data presentation and visualisation for various audiences, such as local decision-makers, citizens, LGAs, central level agents, international financing institutions and donors. Mr. Kopanyi explored the functions and manifestations of budgets and financial report and provided suggestions on the appropriate story creation. <em>\"If the reports are not clear enough, you should not expect that the reader will see and understand the story behind it\"</em>, said the Instructor. <em>\"If you give the report in the raw form, they will not be able to read it through, thus, you should tell the story in a manner appropriate for the concrete audience\". </em>  </p>\r\n<p title=\"3SS_19\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//3SS_19.jpg\" alt=\"3SS_19\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The last afternoon of the Summer School was devoted to expanding the Fiscal Decentralisation Monitoring. Natasha Ilijeva-Acevska, NALAS Program Officer for Fiscal Decentralisation, and a coordinator of the Summer School, provided an overview of the NALAS concept for Fiscal Decentralisation Monitoring and presented the results of the latest Fiscal Indicators Report for South-East Europe 2006-2014, prepared by the NALAS Fiscal Decentralisation Task Force. <em>\"The Report shows that decentralisation in the SEE Region is a work in progress, that currently needs refuelling\"</em>, said Ms. Ilijeva-Acevska. <em>\"That is a complex process, that can succeed only with strong political will, strong advocacy from LGAs, strategic approach, permanent dialogue, evidence-based arguments, and much more\"</em>.   </p>\r\n<p title=\"3SS_24\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//3SS_24.jpg\" alt=\"3SS_24\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><em>\"The last edition of the Fiscal Decentralisation Report is the best one\"</em>, said in the discussion Adrian Mirou Lamba, from the Romanian Association of Communes. <em>\"Therefore, we translated it in Romanian language, by using our own resources\"</em>.</p>\r\n<p>Looking for innovative ways of data collection and strengthening the impact of the report, three illustration presentations were delivered.</p>\r\n<p>Jelena Janevska, NALAS Knowledge and Communications Manager, presented the draft solution for NALAS Intranet, the functions it provides and the use of the system that participants can make. The presentation tried to inspire ideas for technical solutions that can support the collaborative work, data collection and presentation. <em>\"NALAS Intranet is </em><em>e</em><em>ngaging ICT for</em><em>: i</em><em>mproving the internal efficiency and effectiveness</em><em>, automatising processes, e</em><em>asing collaborative work, </em><em>increasing participation, creating feedback mechanisms, improving M&amp;E, evidence-based decision-making and improving reporting\", </em>said Ms. Janevska.</p>\r\n<p title=\"3SS_25\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//3SS_25.jpg\" alt=\"3SS_25\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><em>\"This system looks very good and it will further improve the good work NALAS is doing to support all of us\"</em>, said in the discussion Osman Sadikaj, a municipal Finance Manager and member of the NALAS Fiscal Decentralisation Task Force. <em>\"Some month ago, I have used the Quick Response service to find out about regulation of local markets throughout SEE. The input I got was with very good quality and delivered very fast\"</em>.</p>\r\n<p>Zana Djukic, from the Union of Municipalities of Montenegro (UMM) and member of the NALAS Fiscal Decentralisation Task Force presented the Montenegrin Municipal Finances at the UMM website, inspired by the experience of the NALAS Fiscal Decentralisation Indicators Report. <em>\"This is a simply organised and presented situation of the aggregate financial condition of the Montenegrin local governments\"</em>, said Ms. Djukic, presenting the website.</p>\r\n<p title=\"3SS_26\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//3SS_26.jpg\" alt=\"3SS_26\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Mr. Dario Runtic, from the Association of Cities of the Republic of Croatia presented the Fiscal Database of Croatian Cities. <em>\"Among other things, this database provides information on all investments in local governments in any part of the country, and visualises these information via interactive maps\"</em>, said Mr. Runtic.    </p>\r\n<p title=\"3SS_27\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//3SS_27.jpg\" alt=\"3SS_27\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>In the wrap-up session, evaluating the third Summer School participants said:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>I am amazed by the level of participation in all sessions. Presentations were excellent, explaining different case-studies from different places of the world. The exchange of experiences among participants was extremely useful. In the zipped, very intensive Summer School, the cultural visits were a great break.</li>\r\n<li>This is my first SS. It is very good that a professional goes out of the office, to see where we are and where we want to go. I am very satisfied with the organisation, you even overcome our language barriers.</li>\r\n<li>I'm glad to see that benchmarking in SEE is moving forward and I want to congratulate you for this and stimulate you to go further. We are very interested to contribute to advancing the fiscal decentralisation in the Region. I would like to thank all participants for their active participation and sharing.</li>\r\n<li>I am at the same time happy and sad. Happy because I've seen how important and well organised this Summer School is. I am sad because again I see how little I know and how much I have to learn. It is not really being sad, but more looking forward to learn more. In general, I am very satisfied, very happy to be here.</li>\r\n<li>The first two days were very interesting to me, learning about the experiences of other cities, such as Istanbul and Prague.</li>\r\n<li>I would like to thank the World Bank, as we came on their invitation, as MFSA users. I would also like to thank NALAS for the great organisation and I am a bit sad that we are leaving.</li>\r\n<li>To me, being present at two editions of the Summer School, this one, due to the bigger size was a real Summer School. Although we represent smaller municipalities the experiences and examples shared were extremely useful, especially related to the budget control. The only thing I lacked was more basic information about MFSA, as we had no experience with it before.</li>\r\n<li>This Summer School topic was very important and interesting for us, as the main battle in our countries at the moment is related to financing, especially financing of investment projects. Providing arguments and evidences is key role in this process. Thanks to NALAS for organising one more great event.</li>\r\n<li>Being here for the first time, the Summer School exceeded my expectations. We discussed very important issues related to the environment, strategy development and budget planning.</li>\r\n<li>I am very satisfied with the Summer School and the great selection of topics. The experiences of organising and presenting national data were very inspiring.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em>\"I find the diverse audience of the Summer School very enriching. The exchange among municipalities using the MFSA, NALAS Fiscal Decentralisation Task Force members and NALAS member LGAs that collect and present national data was extremely useful. There is a demand from all to continue and do more and we will be happy to support this\"</em>, said Sabine Palmreuther from the World Bank Urban Partnership Program in her closing remarks.      </p>\r\n<p>All participants of the third NALAS Summer School on Local Governance and Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations received certificates for participation. We thank them all for their active involvement, this has been a quite inspiring group and we are looking forward to meeting you next year.</p>\r\n<p title=\"3SS_28\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//3SS_28.jpg\" alt=\"3SS_28\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p>The Summer School was not only a great opportunity to learn about finances, but also a chance to enjoy the City of Ohrid, one of the oldest human settlements in Europe and one of the oldest and deepest lakes in the world, declared UNESCO World Heritage. Participants enjoyed a boat ride, a guided tour in the City of Ohrid and a visit to the landmark of  the Monastery of St.Naum Ohridski and the springs of the river Black Drim.</p>\r\n<p

The theme for the Symposium is the Regional Cooperation for protection of the Danube River.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"There is nothing stronger than when local governments get together to take a common action. It is even more powerful when this is done at transnational level. That is the future of how the global challenges will be tackled in the future: global leadership and common agenda in one hand and local governments aligning behind it to make it work\", </em>said Kelmend Zajazi, NALAS Executive Director, in his opening speech.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Danube2\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Danube2.JPG\" alt=\"Danube2\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>\"<em>NALAS priority in this sector is to improve collaborative governance and management of water utilities. Coordinated capacity development of water utilities along with the capacities of elected officials to understand the needs and take leadership. </em><em>This is reflected in NALAS – IAWD partnership we are developing around specific projects, the most important one being the Regional Capacity Development Network (RCDN) for the water sector\"</em>, explained Zajazi.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"NALAS member LGAs have been active in improving the national policies. SOS from Slovenia, for instance, succeeded to make the right to water a constitutional right of Slovenian citizens as a public good managed by the state, preventing this way a future commercial treatment of water as a commodity\"</em>, said Zajazi.</p>\r\n<p>Miodrag Gluscevic, from the Standing Conference of Towns and Municipalities (SCTM) in the Republic of Serbia, the host of NALAS’ Solid Waste and Water Management Task Force, pointed out that the strongest pressure in Serbia in regards to the waste water treatment is coming from the EU accession process. In that regards, negotiations for the most complex and most demanding area is the Chapter 27 on environment. The SCTM actively participates in the accession negotiation being part of the Negotiation Group.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Danube3\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Danube3.JPG\" alt=\"Danube3\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><em>“The local governments in Serbia face tremendous challenges in this area. Only 27% of them treat the waste water in a situation where the European standards require that all the LGs in the Danube watershed must have treatment equipment. It influences on the investments in the area of environment which are roughly estimated between 10-15 billion of EUR for building of 250 – 300 waste water treatment plants. In the same time the LGs have no adequate administrative structures on environment. Actually, only 3% of the LGs have established departments for water and waste water issues”</em>, said Gluscevic.</p>\r\n<p>Tomorrow, round table meetings will be organised with the participation of academics, experts, state officials and local government representatives.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>For more information: www.marmaradenizisempozyumu.com</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p title=\"Danube3\"> </p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Danube1.JPG", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Danube2.JPG", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Danube3.JPG", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Danube1.JPG", "path": "low-Danube1.JPG", "checksum": "607a28389b61f40453061ba6420183d0", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-Danube1.JPG"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Danube2.JPG", "path": "Danube2.JPG", "checksum": "1a2227eb3355b6f10297464f86b02cd2", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Danube2.JPG"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Danube3.JPG", "path": "Danube3.JPG", "checksum": "c2d6c4fd7fdbd2de39c37a970dee75c5", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Danube3.JPG"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

We, the local governments from SEE are recognising this contribution and appreciate this initiative</em><em>.” - </em>stated Ms.Golubovic. <em> </em></p>\r\n<p><em><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//OpeningremarksForum.jpg\" alt=\"DusankaGolubovic\" width=\"400\"></em></p>\r\n<p>Ms. Golubovic also emphasized local governments’ role in the effective implementation of the MAP REA: <em>“</em><em>Having taken note of the NALAS/KDZ survey and the recommendations of the NALAS and World Bank City-to-City Dialogue event recently held in Skopje, I think that it is quite clear that the question is not “IF” but rather <strong>“HOW”</strong> to involve the local government level as a strategic shareholder in MAP REA. Local governments are the key actors in preparing, promoting and successfully create in coordination with all other government tiers - the business community, academia and civil society organisations - an environment conducive for boosting investment, generating quality growth, the creation of jobs and contribute to the well-being of the citizens in the Western Balkans.</em><em>”</em></p>\r\n<p><em><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//AudiencePoland.jpg\" alt=\"Audience \" width=\"400\"></em></p>\r\n<p>The Head of Office of the Secretary General of RCC (Regional Cooperation Council), Ms. Elda Kalaja, indicated the importance to involve LGs in the implementation of MAP REA and mentioned in this context NALAS as a strategic partner of RCC.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//EldaKalaja.jpg\" alt=\"RCCPoznan\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The Forum will be a meeting of cities from the Western Balkans and partners participating in the Berlin Process providing the opportunity for an exchange with the European Commission, the Regional Cooperation Council and the Committee of the Regions to discuss the support on the Western Balkans in the process of European Integration and economic transformation.</p>\r\n<p>All NALAS members Associations Presidents and Executive Directors will participate along with other cities and regions from Poland.</p>\r\n<p>NALAS expectations are to send a clear message from the local level to the Western Balkan Policy Summit in Poznan to open up a space within the Berlin process for local governments to be heard, consulted and involved. This will help to recognise and use effectively the potential of cities, towns and municipalities in the frame of the Western Balkan Regional Economic Area (MAP REA) and to consolidate and keep the dynamics in EU integration process afloat.</p>\r\n<p title=\"DusankaGolubovic\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//NALASForum.jpg\" alt=\"NALAS\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p title=\"NALAS\"> </p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-ForumOpening.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//OpeningremarksForum.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//AudiencePoland.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//EldaKalaja.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//NALASForum.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-ForumOpening.jpg", "path": "low-ForumOpening.jpg", "checksum": "69db258daab4753ba7611618b5e4bb1e", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-ForumOpening.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//OpeningremarksForum.jpg", "path": "OpeningremarksForum.jpg", "checksum": "25727c45c840b7f306777f1eaa7ce93a", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//OpeningremarksForum.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//AudiencePoland.jpg", "path": "AudiencePoland.jpg", "checksum": "1bd3becc24eaec7a0c9421eba0972c45", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//AudiencePoland.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//EldaKalaja.jpg", "path": "EldaKalaja.jpg", "checksum": "696a8dc4034ba87c8f97dc37379767d6", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//EldaKalaja.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//NALASForum.jpg", "path": "NALASForum.jpg", "checksum": "c1b01cda595cf31fd9db3821f0a459df", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//NALASForum.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

The findings of this assessment provide the point of departure for an evidence-based dialogue with the EU Commission’s DG NEAR, the Regional Cooperation Council (RCC) and the WB6 national governments. In this context, the Poznan Summit in July 2019 and its side events will be the ideal platform for such an exchange.</p>\r\n<p>The report’s objective was to assess the involvement of local governments and local government issues in the MAP/RIRA and make recommendations for the better inclusion of local governments’ concerns. Hence, the assessment’s central task consisted in analyzing gaps in the MAP REA/RIRA with respect to local governments’ positions and involvement in the further implementation of the MAP REA/RIRA process.</p>\r\n<p>As a general conclusion, it was possible to observe <strong>a general lack of local government interests and local economic development</strong> and low representation of direct approaches for local governments’ roles and action settings.</p>\r\n<p>The evaluation resulted in 47 designated fields. Only one was assessed as “sufficiently covering local concerns”. 23 were assessed as “not sufficiently covering local concerns” in the MAP REA/RIRA, whereas the remaining “do not cover local concerns at all”.</p>\r\n<p>Based on the assessment, a total of 9 recommendations for improving MAP REA and 16 recommendations for NALAS and Regional Cooperation Council (RCC) action were presented.</p>\r\n<p>The assessment was conducted and the report produced by a team of the KDZ-Centre for Public Administration Research from Vienna, Austria.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>To download the report:</p>\r\n<p title='Report “Potential Contributions of SEE Local Governments to the Regional Economic Area\"'><a href=\"/Home/Download/REA_Report\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> Report “Potential Contributions of SEE Local Governments to the Regional Economic Area\"</a></p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Rea_rep.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/REA_Report"], "files": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/REA_Report", "path": "REA_Report", "checksum": "18d886ffbbc75aded69bb198d109dea0", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Home/Download/REA_Report"}], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Rea_rep.jpg", "path": "low-Rea_rep.jpg", "checksum": "4d65718a3cfe7e8c73c490890f719fce", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-Rea_rep.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

Water utilities are strong only if backed by strong and committed local governments and vice versa. Participants underlined that under the current circumstances the liquidity and financial operation of water utilities as well as the support by municipalities as their founders is a key issue.</p>\r\n<p>The webinar, focused on “Cooperation between local government units and public utility companies in providing water and sanitation services during the COVID-19 pandemic”, was moderated by Ms. Aida Jusufhodžić, RCDN Capacity Development Product Manager from Aquasan Network in BiH who introduced the topic underlining that the uninterrupted provision of water services is essential in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, reduced number of employees, lack of adequate protection equipment, decrease of revenues as a result of decreased economic activity and stress on the water supply and wastewater systems due to increased water demands poses a serious challenge.</p>\r\n<p>The keynote speakers were: Mr. Darko Tomaš, Mayor of Prnjavor, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr. Miodrag Glušćević, Programme Director for Urban Development, Environment and Communal Affairs of the Standing Conference of Towns and Municipalities from Serbia and Chair of the NALAS Task Force in Solid Waste and Water Management, Mr. Stojan Eftimov, Technical Manager in PUC Komunalec – Strumica, North Macedonia and Mr. Milan Bulatović, President of the Association of Waterworks from Montenegro.</p>\r\n<p>Participants learnt from Mr. Eftimov that the PUC Komunalec Strumica has re-organised itself well to continue providing safe and uninterrupted water services to citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic. Amongst others, knowledge and experience gained through the last-year training on risk management provided by the Public Utility Association ADKOM was successfully put in practice.</p>\r\n<p>Mayor Tomaš shared experience on how the pandemic has affected investments in the Municipality of Prnjavor. He underlined that there will be no budgetary cuts with regards to the infrastructure investments in the water and sanitation services sector and emphasised once again their importance.</p>\r\n<p>Exchange between the water utilities in Montenegro and support provided by their national Association was presented by Mr. Bulatović. He commended national authorities for their timely and effective response to the crisis situation. Cooperation and coordination between the Association and other institutions was intensive and fruitful, in particular with the Union of Municipalities of Montenegro.</p>\r\n<p>Mr. Gluščević confirmed that the Mayors in Serbia are fully aware of the need to respond to the crisis situation by enabling conditions for uninterrupted service delivery to all citizens including vulnerable groups. He emphasized that the public takes the water and sanitation service for granted, and when they are not available, they become important news.</p>\r\n<p>Participants were able to send their questions in advance or to pose them directly during the webinar. They were interested to find out whether the COVID-19 pandemic contributes to increasing water utilities’ operational costs; how it affects technical performance; existence of procedures for implementing emergency measures, etc.</p>\r\n<p>Under the current circumstances the liquidity and financial operation of water utilities as well as the support by municipalities as their founders is a key issue and therefore will be one of topics for the next RCDN webinars.</p>\r\n<p>Some of the conclusions of the Webinar were the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Water utilities provide extended services with less resources i.e. funds and people.</li>\r\n<li>COVID-19 has imposed the crisis management, and particularly financial management, as a top subject for further RCDN capacity development measures.</li>\r\n<li>Cooperation between local governments and water utilities is crucial at all times, but especially during crisis. Water utilities are strong only if backed by strong and committed local government units and vice versa.</li>\r\n<li>COVID-19 challenge is also an opportunity for water services to become more visible and acknowledged in the public since they are “invisible” under normal circumstances, but becoming top news for the public in case of crisis as such.</li>\r\n<li>COVID-19 is also the opportunity for water utilities to grow stronger and enhance their resilience to crisis through introducing new services and making important strategic decisions.</li>\r\n<li>Water utilities representatives confirmed that citizens were provided with safe water and sanitation services throughout the pandemic.</li>\r\n<li>As seen in the video presented at the beginning of the webinar, researchers from the Netherlands and Switzerland were able to trace COVID-19 in the urban wastewater. This is important information and wastewaters could be used for further research for monitoring COVID-19 and establishing early warning system.</li>\r\n<li>Associations of local governments and water utilities have been strong support to their members during the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>\r\n<li>This crises situation calls for expressing great appreciation to people working in the water and sanitation services sector, both to decision-makers but also to those being exposed on daily basis when working on water supply and wastewater systems.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>All participants highly appreciated the opportunity to participate in this virtual discussion and welcomed the initiative and excellent organisation of the event. During the event, the key note speakers and participants have already identified several topics to be tackled at future webinars. They have put the highest priority on the one dealing with the financial liquidity of water utilities and the respective support by the local government units as their founders.</p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-RCDN_web1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-RCDN_web1.jpg", "path": "low-RCDN_web1.jpg", "checksum": "2e85e4f9c1ed5d0baf26f0204cb0eadd", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-RCDN_web1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

This has been achieved thanks to the effective use of EU support in midst of a decentralization process where Local governments contributed decisively. In this context, Poland has shown that sustainable development can be achieved as EU member, being at the same time inspiring and motivating for the WB6 countries.</p>\r\n<p>Involving Local Government Associations at regional and national level as strategic dialogue partners was a recommendation voiced to all participants, who take sustainable and inclusive development seriously.</p>\r\n<p>Darko Mrvaljevic from NALAS presented the key findings of the recent NALAS/KDZ survey “Potential contributions of South-East European Local Governments to the Regional Economic Area – MAP REA”. The results highlight the potential contributions of the local governments to the Regional Economic Area. The case studies on Local Economic Development from Albania, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Serbia and Austria, which are annexed to the survey, strikingly demonstrate the role of local governments to attract investments and encourage businesses to grow regional. They further show the importance of decentralization and fiscal autonomy and increase of endogenous potentials for economic development. In this context, NALAS was proposed as regional hub to complement MAP REA and to fully exploit its implementation potential by including direct approaches for local governments’ roles and action settings.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//DarkoKDZNALAS18.jpg\" alt=\"DarkoPanel\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The objective, aim, structure of the Regional Decentralisation Observatory - RDO, a monitoring tool for measuring and comparing the degree of decentralization and its policy in SEE, was presented by Boran Ivanovski from NALAS. RDO developed by NALAS in cooperation with OSCE and initial support by RCC showed in its internal report findings that a clear trend becomes obvious. By comparing the autonomy and quality of local service dimensions, the trend towards decreasing local investment capacity is apparent. Low scores on the communal services index in energy efficiency, urban mobility and non-satisfactory index findings on solid-waste management and water and sanitation highlight the fact of underperformance of local governments in the local service dimension. This fact is due to decreased financial resources and goes in hand with an increase of dependence on central government block grants at the same time.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//BoranI19.jpg\" alt=\"ForumPhotoBoranI\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The panel discussion on quality of public services was enhanced with NALAS contributions from Danijela Djurovic (Vice Mayor of Herceg Novi, Montenegro) and NALAS Task Force members on Solid waste and Water management, Irem Silajdzic (Bosnia Herzegovina) and Miodrag Glusevic (Serbia). Regarding investment requirements, the NALAS panelists agreed that a major limitation lies within capital investment for the water and supply and waste infrastructure. Besides structural bottlenecks due to outdated or overloaded infrastructure, the adjustment of tariffs pose a serious challenge together with shortcoming in professionalized staffing. Actually, tariffs do not reflect the actual cost for water supply or waste disposal and are therefore not fulfilling the purpose of recovering costs, thus leaving local governments with financial deficits. There was consensus regarding the priority of directing capital investment in infrastructure replacement, modernization and extension in compliance with environmental standards. In general terms, insufficient financial resources were identified as mayor limitations for utilities and services regarding the quality aspect of public service delivery.</p>\r\n<p title=\"LocalGovernentPanel\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//6june2019panel.jpg\" alt=\"LocalGovernentPanel\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p title=\"LocalGovernentPanel\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//PanelPoland.jpg\" alt=\"Panel\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p title=\"ForumPhotoBoranI\"> </p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-2DayForum.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//DirectorZajazi.JPG", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//DarkoKDZNALAS18.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//BoranI19.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//6june2019panel.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//PanelPoland.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-2DayForum.jpg", "path": "low-2DayForum.jpg", "checksum": "7630c33be5a9bd0ebda3ecc01feec351", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-2DayForum.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//DirectorZajazi.JPG", "path": "DirectorZajazi.JPG", "checksum": "f173f42c854c3f187426f33bff8a9237", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//DirectorZajazi.JPG"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//DarkoKDZNALAS18.jpg", "path": "DarkoKDZNALAS18.jpg", "checksum": "55d70c1a8f385b23a94f88989ffba6d3", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//DarkoKDZNALAS18.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//BoranI19.jpg", "path": "BoranI19.jpg", "checksum": "6af4461c18bb4fa0d1404c56626608f4", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//BoranI19.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//6june2019panel.jpg", "path": "6june2019panel.jpg", "checksum": "62b4486b9584584478a2efe00573e493", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//6june2019panel.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//PanelPoland.jpg", "path": "PanelPoland.jpg", "checksum": "98f0ad4e13932efcd691438ac30d5c34", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//PanelPoland.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

{"parent_url": "http://www.nalas.eu/news/?page=11", "url": "http://www.nalas.eu/News/SWM_web1", "title": "Continuity of waste management service during COVID-19 crisis ensured, but liquidity under a threat  ", "article_index": 109, "published_on": "25.05.2020", "body": "<div class=\"description col-md-12\">\r\n                <p>The first of the NALAS Online Discussion Series in Solid Waste Management during COVID-19 crisis was held on 20 May 2020, with over 50 participants. The discussion focused on analising waste management operations during the pandemics, starting from waste collection, through transport and treatment to disposal.</p>\r\n<p>The discussion was moderated by Miodrag Gluščević, Programme Director at the Standing Conference of Towns and Municipalities of Serbia and a host of NALAS Task Force on Solid Waste and Water Management.</p>\r\n<p>The expert panel included:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Thomas Nylund, Former CEO of „Gästrike återvinnare” Regional PUC for Waste Management, Sweden</li>\r\n<li>Danijela Đurović, Deputy Mayor, City of Herceg Novi, Montenegro</li>\r\n<li>Željko Aćimović, Economic Affairs Manager, PUC „Gradsa čistoća“ Belgrade, Serbia</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>During the discussion, the panelists assessed the implications of the virus threat on one hand, and preventive measures and movement restrictions, on the other. They covered issues related to the organisation of services, changes in quantities and morphology of waste, and how it affects pickup routs and the number of collection stations. They also touched upon the effects of the crisis on the source separation, recycling and treatment of waste, and possible changing of the waste and recycling targets. Finally, they shed light on the very serious issue of liquidity of the waste operators due to the drop in the collection rates and increased operational expenditures.</p>\r\n<p>The general perception of the audience was that the waste management service functioned without delay and interference, and for that to happen, numerous measures in the organisation of operations had to be implemented,  noted the panelists.</p>\r\n<p title=\"SWM_webE\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//SWM_webE.jpg\" alt=\"SWM_webE\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>In <strong>Sweden</strong> the collection of household waste as municipal responsibility was given a high priority during the coronavirus crisis for sanitary reasons. It is classified as a critical societal operation and appropriate crisis planning was done to ensure continuity of service under the specific conditions. The crisis planning also included prioritisation of collection points in case of lack of capacity, such as housing areas with a dense population. When it comes to recycling yards or centers for bulky waste were opened in usual hours but with some limitations regarding visitors at the same time to avoid crowds.</p>\r\n<p>Customer information was very important for waste management operations. Instructions  to close garbage bags properly with double knots, or not to overfill the bins, nor to throw garbage on the ground were communicated to customers in Sweden. Messages from the central government like a call for the citizens to stay at home if they feel sick, to use gloves and keep distances and avoid the peak hours were redistributed by PUC.</p>\r\n<p title=\"SWMwebF\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//SWMwebF.jpg\" alt=\"SWMwebF\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>Montenegro</strong> reacted promptly to respond to the pandemics. From the PUCs it was demanded to keep the operations running, but also introduce additional prevention measues, such as disinfection of garbage trucks, bins, and equipment using chlorin based solutions prescribed by the WHO. The number of pick up points and frequency were reduced. Ensuring sufficient workforce was one of the main issues for PUCs since some of the staff was quaranteened. Waste collected in Herceg Novi dropped by 20%. Disinfection of public areas and street cleaning were more frequent, so other services like the rescue had to step in with the humanpower and equipment.</p>\r\n<p title=\"SWMwebC\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//SWMwebC.jpg\" alt=\"SWMwebC\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The economic measures introduced by the central level in many cases included delayed payment of utility bills and subsidies for vulnerable categories, which affected the liquidity of PUCs and put waste management operations under additional pressure. In the <strong>City of Belgrade, Serbia</strong>, the PUC “Gradska Cistoca” is part of the collective billing system where one of the measures was a delay of payments for elderly citizens above 65 years of age for February, March, and April 2020 with no interest rate for the company. Also, no force collection was conducted during the stage of an emergency. Regular discounts for on-time payments stayed in force and no charges were introduced for late payments. The decline in the collection rate for “Gradska Cistoca” was 11%, but in Serbia overall it was much higher. The biggest decline was from the business sector. In the short run operations were managed, but in the long run that would be very hard.</p>\r\n<p>In Belgrade, a rotation was introduced to ensure sufficient healthy workforce. The drop of primary selection was notable and, in some cases, it went up to 57%. The critical factor for the waste management services is acquiring materials and goods from abroad and limited storage space for the recyclables. The recommendation is to rely more on local producers.</p>\r\n<p title=\"SWM_webD\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//SWMwebD.jpg\" alt=\"SWM_webD\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p title=\"SWM_webD\"> </p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SWM_webB.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//SWM_webE.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//SWMwebF.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//SWMwebC.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//SWMwebD.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SWM_webB.jpg", "path": "low-SWM_webB.jpg", "checksum": "19170496ff3c4fbc4a60b2789a7a943d", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SWM_webB.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//SWM_webE.jpg", "path": "SWM_webE.jpg", "checksum": "e245e2e937760c189a5de8e68d1a3f23", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//SWM_webE.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//SWMwebF.jpg", "path": "SWMwebF.jpg", "checksum": "64ab6de7b010ab0cd5543b075ce6e7e6", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//SWMwebF.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//SWMwebC.jpg", "path": "SWMwebC.jpg", "checksum": "1e0e65a0e110d7609cec9d20809612c0", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//SWMwebC.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//SWMwebD.jpg", "path": "SWMwebD.jpg", "checksum": "7f06c5a81affadc5e2b0b7927f0610b1", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//SWMwebD.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

The webinar drew a global audience, with almost 80 participants hailing from as far as Japan discussing the lessons learned in a global crisis.</p>\r\n<p>The webinar was moderated by Mr. Kelmend Zajazi, Executive Director of NALAS. <em>“These are extraordinary times, and now, while many are preparing to return to normal operations, is maybe the right time to reflect how we have been managing the crisis and how we should ensure business continuity and build more resiliency into systems to overcome future crises”, </em>said Mr. Zajazi in his opening address.  </p>\r\n<p>The panel presented a wide spectrum of perspectives: Ms. Lindita Atanasova, Technical Director of the water supply and sewerage utility of Skopje, represented the supply side. Ms. Bojana Kondić Panić, Chief of Cabinet of the Mayor of Laktashi, Bosnia and Herzegovina, told of experiences from the municipal point of view. Mr. Christian Plohberger, General Manager of Protectum Solutions contributed insights into the crisis management approach of professional security consultants. Additional input came from the audience’s answers to survey questions via Webex chat.</p>\r\n<p>Mr. Christian Plohberger took the podium with a presentation on the basics of prepared crisis response in utility companies, touching all four phases from preparation during normal operations to immediate emergency response, subsequent crisis management and later recovery. He listed the technical contents of a solid pandemics preparedness plan, explained the anatomy of, and responsibility distribution in a crisis management team, noting that as long as such a crisis management structure is at hand, pretty much every crisis in manageable.</p>\r\n<p>Also showing the basics of improvised “60 minutes to reach a decision” emergency crisis management, Mr. Plohberger noted that the current global pandemic presents quite an uncommon calamity:</p>\r\n<p><em>“This is a very long-running crisis, unlike landslides, contaminations and other common threats to water safety”, </em>said Mr. Plohberger. He closed his presentation with a reference to the applicable European and ISO norms and also the <a href=\"https://www.d-leap.org/d-leap/the-programs/water-safety-planning/\">Water Safety and Crisis Management Program</a> offered under D-LeaP.</p>\r\n<p>Next on the podium was Ms. Lindita Atanasova, Technical Director of the Water Supply and Sewerage Utility of Skopje, one of the North Macedonia’s largest public-owned companies. She admitted that COVID-19 took her by surprise. <em>“In the crisis management seminars, I took we discussed pretty much every disaster you can think of, but a pandemic? In the 21<sup>st</sup> century? No, we never imagined we would have to handle something like that</em>”, said Ms. Atanasova. </p>\r\n<p title=\"Lindita_web\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Lindita_web.jpg\" alt=\"Lindita_web\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Nevertheless, a pandemic response plan was at hand, and Ms. Atanasova’s team hit the ground running: <em>“Our company is an integral part of the Skopje crisis management, therefore we enjoyed a very high level of coordination and cooperation”.</em> Which was just as well, because the Skopje utility had to meet quickly fluctuating challenges: <em>“In the beginning the situation changed very dynamically. We had to introduce response measures on a day-to-day basis to ensure continuation of the water supply for 600.000 inhabitants.”</em></p>\r\n<p>The first priority was to protect the staff against infection, with the spectrum of measures including distribution of masks, increased security and entry controls at company buildings, reduced staffing of laboratories and water treatment plants, home office wherever possible, and a staggered leave scheme ensuring that reserves would be at hand in case teams would have to go into quarantine. Another important part of the crisis response was communication: <em>“Throughout the crisis we had to keep informing the public that drinking water was safe”, </em>said Ms. Atanasova. That said, she noted that Water Supply and Sewerage Utility of Skopje has weathered the storm safely: <em>“We were very successful in managing this crisis, keeping our services on the usual high level”.</em></p>\r\n<p>Last to take the stage was Ms. Bojana Kondić Panić, Chief of Cabinet of the Mayor of Laktashi. She added the perspective of a municipality of almost 40.000 inhabitants that struggled with predominantly financial crisis impacts, with increased water consumption from private households, reduced demand from private sector companies, and increasing operation costs adding up to serious challenges.</p>\r\n<p>In the absence of a prepared pandemic response plan, many decisions had to be taken on the run, with a strong focus on hygienic measures, service continuity and continuing necessary infrastructure investments. Thanks to an intact cooperation between city and national government, and additional support by international organisations, the challenges were met, financial stability was secured and all monetary responsibilities were covered. Mrs. Panić said: <em>“Coordination is always important, and it is of special importance in times of crisis. It takes strong and committed local and national governments to keep going in a situation like this”.</em></p>\r\n<p title=\"Bojana_web\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Bojana_web.jpg\" alt=\"Bojana_web\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>During the initial statements, surveys ran in the background, with one of the questions covering the main challenges during the crisis. Here, employee safety was by far the most common answer, and reduced cash flow a not very close runner-up. Participants also had the chance to contribute questions to the panelists, with part two of the webinar dedicated to answering those.</p>\r\n<p>Asked if utilities had done enough advance planning or if the crisis caught them off guard, Mr. Plohberger answered ambiguously, looking back at the considerable number of pandemic plans he has helped set up between 2002 and 2005: <em>“In many cases, pandemic preparation often wound up on the backburner, because this specific threat seemed minimal compared to other emergencies</em>”. He remembers one case where last summer a utility decided to replace a batch of expired protection masks and then wound up sharing the new masks with local health services when COVID-19 hit.</p>\r\n<p>Another question touched the legal requirements regarding pandemic preparation, and here again, Mr. Plohberger answered ambiguously: <em>“Is there a legal requirement to have a plan? Yes – and no. Utilities in the EU are required to follow state of the art best practices, and a pandemic plan is of course part of any good Water Safety Plan, so the requirement, is as a matter of fact, indirect”.</em></p>\r\n<p>One participant asked if the crisis experience might lead to an accelerated shift towards business process automation to reduce health risks to staff. Ms. Atanasova confirmed that automation offers a recommendable path towards more safety for both employees and water supply.</p>\r\n<p>Asked if special crisis plan suggestions were available for small utilities with limited staff resources, Mr. Plohberger showed a special small unit crisis management plan for organizations with under ten employees, with one person covering more than one field of assessment.</p>\r\n<p>Concerning the lessons learned from the experience, Ms. Panić said in her closing statement that the most important lesson from the pandemic was the crucial importance of advance planning and professional risk management. She added that the upside of the situation was an increased visibility of the utility companies, a growing interest in the safety of water supplies during an emergency, and therefore better prospects for future investments to address problems. Proof once again that chances can be found in even the most direct crisis.</p>\r\n<p title=\"Lindita_web\"> </p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Keli_web.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Lindita_web.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Bojana_web.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Keli_web.jpg", "path": "low-Keli_web.jpg", "checksum": "b918030990c6ae5ca662feb8b95f8774", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-Keli_web.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Lindita_web.jpg", "path": "Lindita_web.jpg", "checksum": "1b94495cc9f1604d7f8ef0789888ea18", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Lindita_web.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Bojana_web.jpg", "path": "Bojana_web.jpg", "checksum": "1368beafc6fb45c1d4c030a6a70ef71a", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Bojana_web.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

Local governments have the potential to contribute to improvement of quality public services tapping in the technological advancement. REA should therefore include activities to promote the trends and facilitate exchange with cities from EU member states, link experience of EU MS to challenges and opportunities in candidate countries and foster peer-to-peer on best practices.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Bridge Funding Facility for local governments</strong> to be extended to all WB6 countries - In this regard, support for local governments to access available EU funds and ensure pre-financing of municipal projects through the establishment of a needs-oriented financial instrument would support local governments in preparation and implementation of EU funded projects. Here, a Bridge Funding mechanism could provide for:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Covering temporary shortage of funds in the process of project implementation and</li>\r\n<li>Financing of ineligible costs, which are important in order to ensure the sustainability and integrity of a project.</li>\r\n<li>In order to enhance possibilities of municipalities with insufficient financial resources to participate in EU programmes and access EU funding, NALAS recommends the set-up of a Bridge Funding Facility for Local Governments in the region.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Cohesion policy:</strong> An alternative Cohesion Fund facility for WB6 countries could play a crucial role in supporting our regions and rural areas to keep up with the transformations of the world around us (growing urban-rural divide, climate change, migration). </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Energy Efficiency/Climate change</strong>: extension of CoMo to WB6  - Climate Action and Energy Efficiency Plans at local level are of crucial importance for sustainable economic growth and development. In this context, the Covenant of Mayors, as a bottom-up movement, could be the driver for enabling cities and municipalities of WB6 countries to contribute to 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by localizing them. For this role, NALAS has obtained full support of Energy Cities and the CEMR. In fact, NALAS is in the best position to transfer the Covenant of Mayors model to the region since the network, as of 2010, is part of the CoMo Support Structure.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>All interlocutors from North Macedonia highlighted the ongoing preparations of relaunching the decentralization process in Macedonia, which has been put on a halt since 2005, and expressed their expectations that the proposed devolution of competencies will benefit North Macedonia by and large and help local governments in their daily work to provide quality public services to their citizen.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//NALASVeles.jpg\" alt=\"Veles5\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The enlargement process has been seen as an opportunity to improve the living conditions of Macedonian citizen and to boost the necessary reforms to get the country on the road of inclusive and sustainable long-term development.

This General Assembly was not an ordinary one. Working under the pressure to respond to all the challenges of the COVID-19 crisis, the delegates, Mayors representing NALAS member Associations, casted their votes online, deciding about important NALAS issues for the future.</p>\r\n<p>Based on the rotation Presidency system, Mr. <strong>Emanuil Manolov</strong>, Mayor of Pavlikeni Municipality in Bulgaria, assumed the role of NALAS President, who will lead the Network in the next year.</p>\r\n<p>Mr. Manolov is Mayor of Pavlikeni Municipality since 2011. Under his leadership, the municipality has managed to attract EU funding of 50 million euros and was twice awarded with the European Label of Governance Excellence (ELoGE) of the Council of Europe, while Mr. Manolov received the prestigious award \"Mayor of the Month\" in the categories \"Agriculture\" and \"Water Attractions\".</p>\r\n<p title=\"Manolov2\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Manolov2.jpg\" alt=\"Manolov2\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>JJ: Mayor Manolov, congratulations for the new role you just assumed, President of NALAS. Since you have been a Vice-President of the Network and a Delegate in its General Assembly on behalf of the National Association of Municipalities in the Republic of Bulgaria (NAMRB), you are quite familiar with NALAS’ work. What does NALAS mean to you personally, as a Mayor?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>EM:</strong> Assuming the role of President of the Network of Associations of Local Authorities of South-East Europe is a great honour, at the same time serious responsibility. The Network has proven itself as an organisation, capable of supporting its members in the process of decentralisation and strengthening the democratic processes in accordance with the principles of the European Charter for Local Self-Government.</p>\r\n<p>Over the years, NALAS has managed to build an effective, competent and qualified team and leadership. Through its active work, the organisation has gained popularity not only in the region but also at international stage, and is increasingly recognised as a key partner for the development of local authorities in SEE.</p>\r\n<p>As a delegate to the General Assembly and a participant in other events organised by NALAS, I can conclude that the organisation is not only quickly developing and finding new spheres for its activities, but also successfully establishes new partnerships in the face of the European Commission, the Regional Cooperation Council, the Council of European Municipalities and Regions, etc. Thanks to pragmatic solutions and generated ideas, the members of the Network can count on a reliable partner to find solutions to current issues and topics, not only of regional, but also of global importance, that affect the functioning of local authorities, while taking into account their local specificities and needs.</p>\r\n<p>Coming to the question of the importance of NALAS to me personally as a Mayor - it is a source of ideas, inspiration and an opportunity to share experiences and practices with each other. Creating a network of contacts and cooperation with partners from other countries in the region gives us a different perspective and at the same time is a chance to get to know each other better in our cultural diversity. Taking the advantage of cross-border cooperation opportunities, local authorities can work more successfully on joint projects that lead to better results and improve the lives of our citizens.</p>\r\n<p>We have the capacity to build sustainable communities based on smart and innovative growth through quality services and job creation. NALAS support for capacity building, advocacy, including access to alternative financial instruments and participation in various projects is crucial for the professional evolution of our administrations, for expanding the instruments and areas in which we can be of support to our citizens, for the regional cohesion, for the implementation of international commitments for sustainable development or for attracting investment.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Download the full interview:</em> <br></strong></p>\r\n<p title=\"Interview with NALAS President, Mayor Emanuil Manolov\"><a href=\"/Home/Download/Interview-President_Manolov\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> Interview with NALAS President, Mayor Emanuil Manolov</a></p>\r\n<p title=\"Manolov2\"> </p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Manolov1.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Manolov2.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/Interview-President_Manolov"], "files": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/Interview-President_Manolov", "path": "Interview-President_Manolov", "checksum": "2836edd954fec38451725bfed74194b0", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Home/Download/Interview-President_Manolov"}], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Manolov1.jpg", "path": "low-Manolov1.jpg", "checksum": "e0c9edf1018ae5f4c827efa01ce5bbf9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-Manolov1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Manolov2.jpg", "path": "Manolov2.jpg", "checksum": "f715db0e80bc09f8db2e25da2d9bf886", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Manolov2.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

The wide-spread consumerism has a tendency to overwhelm us with material goods that eventually have to end up somewhere. Being reused, recycled, properly taken care of, or dumped anywhere – the decision is to be made by us all, but operationalised by the waste management operators, and the municipalities, that in many cases are their owners.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Have you ever wondered how much waste do we produce? Where does it end up? Is the way we manage our waste the right one? How do we stand compared to others? These and many other questions are being addressed by the <strong>NALAS Benchmarking Report on Solid Waste Management in South-East Europe</strong>. We have in hand the last edition of the Report, available <a href=\"http://www.nalas.eu/News/SWM_Rep_2019\">HERE</a>.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Today, bringing the Report closer to you, we talk to <strong>Ms. Danijela Djurovic and Mr. Boran Ivanoski</strong>, who are part of the team that developed the Report. Namely, this report is a joint effort by the members of NALAS Task Force on Solid Waste and Water Management. It is utilising data from 2018 from ten economies of the SEE region.</em></p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p title=\"IBoran1\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//IBoran1.JPG\" alt=\"IBoran1\" width=\"132\" height=\"159\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>Mr. Boran Ivanoski</strong> is NALAS Program Officer, in charge of the Task Force on Solid Waste and Water Management. Mr. Ivanoski has initiated the development of the benchmarking report and coordinated its three editions. Mr. Ivanoski is an engineer, a nature lover and environmentalist, with long-lasting experience in local government development.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JJ: Mr. Ivanoski, what was your guiding star when you initiated the </strong><strong>NALAS Benchmarking Report on Solid Waste Management? To whom you address the Report and what it aims to achieve?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>BI: </strong>The idea was initiated by the NALAS Task Force on Solid Waste and Water Management back in 2015. Within the Task Force, local practitioners were exchanging their challenges and discussed possible solutions. They concluded that there is a need to compare the status quo in SWM at local level among the 12 economies from the region of SEE. That’s why, they have decided to establish a systematic monitoring tool based on research methodology with 24 indicators that are measurable with data deriving from different national contexts and what is even more important they are comparable at regional level. Why comparable indicators are important, because the main aim of the report and this exercise itself is to learn from different experiences. Although we call the Report benchmarking, we would rather use the word bench-learning. It helps NALAS members to understand the current situation in their respective national contexts and to exchange with their peers from the region for better solutions. In this direction, our member Associations share the report among their members, the local governments, within their expert bodies that deal with SWM issues, national institutions, academia, etc. In addition, the Associations of local governments use the main findings of the Report and best practices for advocacy actions in negotiations with the line ministries.</p>\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n<p title=\"Dan2\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Dan2.jpg\" alt=\"Dan2\" width=\"224\" height=\"150\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>Ms. Danijela Djurovic</strong> is a member of the NALAS Solid Waste and Water Management Task Force, on behalf of the Union of Municipalities of Montenegro, coming from the coastal City of Herceg Novi, a true pearl of the Adriatic Sea. Ms. Djurovic is an engineer, specialised in environmental protection. She is a Vice Mayor of Herceg Novi, a former President of the City Assembly, City Manager and Director of the Waste Management Company. This brings Ms. Djurovic to a unique position to not only understand the challenges of solid waste management, but also see and address them from the perspective of a high local level authority.</p>\r\n<p><strong>JJ: Ms. Djurovic, based on the Report findings and your professional experience, what are the main challenges that local governments and their waste management companies in South-East Europe face?  </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>DDj: </strong>It is a common opinion that the lack of financing and high investments in waste management are the two basic issues that waste management companies and municipalities struggle with. Often central governments impose laws hard to be implemented on the local level and that is contributing to more stress when working within the sector. On the other hand, there are many good examples of waste management in simple solutions. It is not always needed to implement high-end solutions, but those that best serve the local needs and practices. Other challenge that is stressing the system is political influence. Unfortunately, due to political changes the decision-makers, but also waste management CEO’s are often changed, lacking the continuity of work and even more, investment ideas. Waste management is a specific sector. Either you love it or you hate it. Decision makers, when not coming from the sector, tend not to understand the specifics and needs, which leads to misunderstanding and poor management. Waste management definitely should be led by dedicated professionals from the sector.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Download the full interview:</strong></em></p>\r\n<p title=\"Interview SWM Report 2020\"><a href=\"/Home/Download/Interview_RSWM\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> Interview SWM Report 2020</a></p>\r\n<p title=\"SWMR19\"> </p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Dan1.jpg", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//IBoran1.JPG", "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Dan2.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/Interview_RSWM"], "files": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/Interview_RSWM", "path": "Interview_RSWM", "checksum": "c59f1f8aeb85ebe55f876d729f192227", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Home/Download/Interview_RSWM"}], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Dan1.jpg", "path": "low-Dan1.jpg", "checksum": "37112c3b5d014c020ada6e273a46d3ae", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-Dan1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//IBoran1.JPG", "path": "IBoran1.JPG", "checksum": "58b2da01808f564702062e8890e0e5d8", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//IBoran1.JPG"}, {"url": "http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Dan2.jpg", "path": "Dan2.jpg", "checksum": "64628361a43b253bee8ca04d21820592", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Dan2.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

During the progress of the pandemic and the lockdown, local authorities and public utility companies had to adapt to new circumstances and ensure the provision of the services in such extraordinary conditions.</p>\r\n<p>Ms. Florinda d’Eugenio, shared that in Italy, the response to the coronavirus epidemic at the local level had to go in two directions. First of all, it was necessary to react quickly and adjust the services to prevent the spread of the virus. Then, amendments to the current regulation on waste were needed, to fill the gaps in service provision caused by changes in waste quantities and morphology. </p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//Ms.Florinda2020.png\" alt=\"Ms.Florinda\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, to prevent the spread of the virus in Italy a clear instruction was given to municipalities and waste operators to distinguish between the waste coming from the medical institutions, mandatory isolations, quarantines, and households with infected citizens, the so-called contaminated waste on one hand, and the waste produced by the general population, on the other. These types had to be handled separately with different priorities in treatment. No separation was practiced with the contaminated waste, and in some regions, PUCs have been instructed to organize specific shifts to collect it and send it as a priority for incineration. </p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//IztokRozman2020.png\" alt=\"IztokRozman\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>With this type of pandemic, it is not necessary to stop separate waste collection from the general population, but in that case, it is critical to dispose of protective equipment such as masks and gloves, but also wipes and disinfectant packaging in special bags that need to be tightly closed, left for 72 hours and only then dispose of with the mixed waste, emphasized Mr. Iztok Rozman. He also shared that in Slovenia, at the peak of pandemic, certain facilities, like recycling yards, have to be closed to avoid waste handlers and workers sorting the waste from being exposed to the risk and even infected. An interesting detail related to the disposal of protective equipment (gloves and masks) and tissues is that, in Slovenia, for example, but also in other places, such materials appeared to a greater extent in wastewater treatment plants, showing that communication with citizens need to be even more intense during crisis times.</p>\r\n<p>Discussion at the panel disclosed that the perception of communal services, including waste management, as an important and irreplaceable precondition for normal functioning and living in the local communities is at a high level and that citizens are ready to follow the instructions that go in the direction of maintaining communal hygiene and public health.  It was recognized that the measures regarding the reaction to COVID pandemic in all European countries are similar and that the differences only occur where the different waste treatment technologies are available. </p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//DraganLazic2020.png\" alt=\"DraganLazic\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>In a crisis like this one introduction of the measures to prevent contagion among workers is one of the crucial issues in the effort to sustain the uninterrupted provision of waste management services. An excellent example in this sense is the organization of daily shifts at the regional landfill Eko-Dep in Bijeljina, where the work was organized so that workers from different shifts did not come into contact, and the facilities that they use were regularly disinfected after each shift was done, as illustrated by Mr. Dragan Lazic. </p>\r\n<p>Participants of the panel, as well as the audience through the poll question, were unanimous in a view that after the medical services, utilities including waste management services, are the most important for maintaining public health and hygiene safety.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//PollPanel2.png\" alt=\"Panel2\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Throughout the discussion, it was concluded that public bodies, and when it comes to waste management those are local authorities and public utility companies, have the obligation to maintain the system and keep it running. So, if in any instance the citizens act inappropriate or don’t know what to do whit the waste, actually the system has failed. This is what needs to be prevented with efficient organization, good communication, precise messages, public health protection, and reliable execution of the services.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SWMPanel2020.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Ms.Florinda2020.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//IztokRozman2020.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//DraganLazic2020.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//PollPanel2.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SWMPanel2020.png", "path": "low-SWMPanel2020.png", "checksum": "97e327e81332f5552d8f5d2c1f96408e", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SWMPanel2020.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//Ms.Florinda2020.png", "path": "Ms.Florinda2020.png", "checksum": "ed104702957b6e4600da8ab29b79911c", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//Ms.Florinda2020.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//IztokRozman2020.png", "path": "IztokRozman2020.png", "checksum": "ce0794174cde073c72c386174b7a05ae", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//IztokRozman2020.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//DraganLazic2020.png", "path": "DraganLazic2020.png", "checksum": "721c3d2c3f75210aacca2572f69ca5c1", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//DraganLazic2020.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//PollPanel2.png", "path": "PollPanel2.png", "checksum": "eb296dbfb1f862ff1c91a7c8809cd758", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//PollPanel2.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

The survey showed significant decrease in the collection rate during March and April 2020 in comparison with the same period last year as well as different patterns of water consumption distribution between industry and households during the pandemic. Almost 80% of the interviewees reported extended scope of work that was not planned and 60% of them reported decrease in planned activities such as water meter reading and replacement.</p>\r\n<p title=\"rcdn2web4\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//rcdn2web4.jpg\" alt=\"rcdn2web4\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>Mr. Filip Makrid</strong> highlighted that Podgorica Water Utility used the crisis to successfully expand digitalisation of all business processes.

sharing their views and addressing important questions, such as local government transfers to water utilities as a result of lower revenues, good models for cooperation between local governments and water utilities and lessons learnt that will help for being better prepared to respond to potential crisis.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The conclusions of the webinar are:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and public health protection measures, water utilities have undertaken additional tasks that are not defined in their action plans, doing so with reduced collection rate and change in service demand.</li>\r\n<li>Methodology for identifying and calculating real costs incurred by water utilities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and extra services provided to community needs to be defined.</li>\r\n<li>Models for covering financial costs resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic need to be proposed to ensure uninterrupted provision of water and wastewater services.</li>\r\n<li>National and local government measures aimed to support the economic sector in overcoming financial difficulties need to be adjusted and applied for water utilities as well.</li>\r\n<li>Local crisis management plans need to be developed and improved by taking into account COVID-19 experiences with measures for ensuring financial liquidity of water utilities under such circumstances.</li>\r\n<li>The reforms of the water service sector shall be promoted to ensure long-term financial sustainability of water utilities and better service delivery in line with the EU Water Framework Directive.</li>\r\n<li>New procedures and technologies need to be introduced for water utilities to enable business continuity and service delivery during crises such as procedures for human resource rationalisation in relation to labour force protection, new working models (e.g. home office), digitalisation of work processes and collection service, etc.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In their evaluation of the webinar, participants expressed the highest satisfaction and identified potential topics for the next webinars, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to waste water treatment plants’ operation, improving crisis management, etc.</p>\r\n<p title=\"rcdn2web2\"><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//rcdn2web2.jpg\" alt=\"rcdn2web2\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p

{"parent_url": "http://www.nalas.eu/news/?page=11", "url": "http://www.nalas.eu/News/SWMWebinars2020", "title": "NALAS concludes its series of Webinars on Solid Waste Management and COVID-19 ", "article_index": 101, "published_on": "10.06.2020", "body": "<div class=\"description col-md-12\">\r\n                <p>The NALAS Panel on “The resilience of the waste management services, present, and future” took place on 3 June 2020. This was the last panel of the series of webinars initiated by NALAS to bring focus to the impact that the COVID-19 outbreak had on the Solid Waste Management process, including public health and safety of workers.</p>\r\n<p>This panel focused on the different resilience aspects of the waste management services including infrastructure (state, investments needs, asset management), coverage (coverage rate, urban-rural rate), technical and human capacities (need for upgrade and capacity development), cooperation with the local self-government and citizens, planning (existence of contingency plans, short, mid, and long term planning, goals), readiness for the climate change, etc. The COVID-19 pandemic served as the driver of the conversation, but the discussion was not exclusively based on this type of crisis and included other natural and man-made hazards.</p>\r\n<p>The Speakers of the panel were:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Ms. Zorica Bilić, GIZ ORF MMS Country Coordinator, Serbia</li>\r\n<li>Mr. Vlatko Jovanovski, Disaster Preparedness and Prevention Initiative SEE, Bosna &amp; Herzegovina</li>\r\n<li>Mr. Felix Schmidt, Strategy end Development Director at SCD Engineers, Switzerland</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//ZoranaBilic.JPG\" alt=\"Zorana\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Ms. Zorica Bilić shared that when it comes to waste management service resilience with the specific focus on COVID-19 pandemic there are four key factors.</p>\r\n<p>First is the ability of the waste management provider <strong>to absorb the initial shock</strong> of a hazardous situation. It is about the awareness of the utility of is vulnerability and preparedness to act in such circumstances. In this respect, the organizational capacity of the company, i.e. the existence of specific health and safety procedures or contingency plans is the key factor of resilience;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The second resilience factor is the <strong>ability to skilfully manage the crisis</strong>. In other words, it is the ability of the leadership or the management of the utility company not just to ensure the safety of their employees but to prevent further spreading of the epidemic to the general public;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The third resilience factor is the <strong>ability to recover quickly and continue with the operations</strong>. In this case, we are speaking about the issues of liquidity, good organizational capacities, relations with local and other levels of governance;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The fourth resilience factor is the utilities’ <strong>ability</strong> <strong>to learn and incorporate lessons</strong> learned from past occurrences into future actions, but also to exchange and use experiences from others in the risk assessment and planning.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//VlatkoJovanovski.png\" alt=\"Vlatko\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>In disaster management and prevention, the role of risk assessment is crucial. It is the most important pillar in preparedness and prevention policies. All the countries in the region include pandemic scenarios in their risk assessments. Ever since the SARAS 2002 pandemic and the MERS outbreak in 2012, countries in the region are considering pandemics in their risk assessments, emphasized Mr. Vlatko Jovanovski.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//FelixShmidt.png\" alt=\"Fellix\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Mr. Felix Schmidt highlighted that when talking about the risks and the waste management services we need to distinguish between the long term risk to the environment, which is related to the treatment and disposal of the waste and the effects on the environment, and the risk to the continuity of the services and possible effects to the human health and society in general. To ensure the minimum of service during the crisis but also to be able to preserve it, in the long run, there are several critical factors of the resilience:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Financial stability</strong> over long periods is connected to the capacity to maintain a good and accurate customer base including households and the commercial sector and industry, as well as to have a functional billing system. This issue is also connected to the budgeting and negotiations with the local authority on the budget of the company, i.e. the price of the service and the tariff system which is always a very tough political issue;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Money or stable <strong>financing</strong> and <strong>liquidity</strong> is one of those factors. It is needed for performing regular tasks, purchasing the fuel and consumable parts such as tires for the garbage trucks, but also for the maintenance and the salaries of the waste operator employees;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Another critical resilience factor is to have available <strong>workforce</strong> and to be able to organize operations on the daily bases without interruptions;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>There are also technical difficulties that companies face during the crisis in the sense of organizing <strong>procurement</strong> and ensuring a regular <strong>supply</strong> of fuel, materials, and equipment (including health and safety equipment for the workers) for smooth operations;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Additional resilience factor on the level of the waste operator is the <strong>organization</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>management</strong> of the company in terms of taking all the necessary decisions on the day to day bases, like the organization of the shifts, routs, collection frequency, etc;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Another crucial point of resilience is the <strong>communication</strong> <strong>capacity</strong> of the utility company. In a time of crisis there is a great need for communication with the people, the customers, workers, authorities, to define the minimum service level that has to be preserved, and all of the mentioned actors, have a specific influence and expectations in that respect. Besides that, it needs to be communicated on how the service will be conducted during the crisis and how the general population should act and contribute to the preservation of the waste management service;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>One more important factor for the resilience of the service is the <strong>stability of the management structure</strong> of the utility regardless of whether the company is public or private. This is because waste management is not a topic that can be learned in school, nor there is formal education for the managers of such companies. Therefore, big fluctuations in management positions are not good for the resilience of companies in emergencies, since experience and good knowledge of the system are necessary to preserve the service performance.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Waste management is a logistic cycle that needs a lot of planning, and if the day to day planning is well-done service can be very efficient, cheaper, and much more resilient. Likewise, planning for emergencies can ensure the continuation of the services, keep the minimum requirements, and preserve the functionality of the utility company. For this operation to be successful, accurate and reliable data (on routes, fuel, shifts, workers, quantities, etc.) is needed as well as the supervision and monitoring to make sound decisions.</p>\r\n<p>One the main conclusions of the Webinar was that to build a resilient system of waste management, first, we need to make sure to optimize the existing one. This is especially important in the SEE regions where waste management systems are overburdened with structural and day to day problems. Optimizing processes, reducing inefficiencies, and increasing the sustainability of utility companies is a precondition to the resilience of the services.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>To read about all the conclusions and recommendations, please click here: </p>\r\n<p title=\"NALAS Panel_“The resilience of the waste management services, present, and future”\"><a href=\"/Home/Download/Panel3_Resilience\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> NALAS Panel_“The resilience of the waste management services, present, and future”</a></p>\r\n<p title=\"Zorana\"> </p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Resilience.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//ZoranaBilic.JPG", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//VlatkoJovanovski.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//FelixShmidt.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/Panel3_Resilience"], "files": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Home/Download/Panel3_Resilience", "path": "Panel3_Resilience", "checksum": "a90be76d21f49d715567c077a56c11b8", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Home/Download/Panel3_Resilience"}], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-Resilience.png", "path": "low-Resilience.png", "checksum": "3830a0f919982522b86941911f536545", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-Resilience.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//ZoranaBilic.JPG", "path": "ZoranaBilic.JPG", "checksum": "76d37938a0ecbe5813f5a68bd7191c7b", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//ZoranaBilic.JPG"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//VlatkoJovanovski.png", "path": "VlatkoJovanovski.png", "checksum": "a46880734840b0dec7e62288a670cea1", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//VlatkoJovanovski.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//FelixShmidt.png", "path": "FelixShmidt.png", "checksum": "3e3f09223b1e5bcf40ff8871bc3ee757", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//FelixShmidt.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png", "path": "pdf.png", "checksum": "8c389034523884b2ef87e287de221cf7", "status": "uptodate", "relative": "/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

In such difficult times, they not only coped with the crisis, providing the necessary prevention measures, supporting vulnerable and subsidising local economies, but many of them also took a brave step forward: using innovation and digitalisation to solve the problems caused by the pandemics.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>What started as a health crisis turned into the biggest economic recession since the World War II, with severe and long-lasting consequences - and it is not over. All local governments of the region have been greatly affected by the crisis, facing huge losses of revenues and extraordinary levels of uncertainty. By 2022, they may lose up to 30% of their revenues, for a total estimated loss of 17 billion Euro, which jeopardises local service provision and infrastructure investments. </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>More than ever, the region needs effective intergovernmental policy consultation and coordination. SEE local governments call for targeted support from central government, increased financial decentralisation, stronger local tax powers and higher intergovernmental transfers. To ensure successful recovery, local economic development must be given a priority.</strong></p>\r\n<p>These are some of the key conclusions of the <strong>Online Mayors’ Conference: South-East European Local Governments in post COVID-19 Socio-Economic Recovery</strong>, organised yesterday by NALAS, under the auspices of NALAS President Emanuil Manolov and the National Association of Municipalities in the Republic of Bulgaria (NAMRB). The conference gathered over 140 Mayors, municipal experts, representatives of NALAS member LGAs and international organisations.</p>\r\n<p title=\"OMC1\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//OMC1.png\" alt=\"OMC1\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<h3><strong><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Key addresses</span> </strong></h3>\r\n<p><em>“Looking ahead</em><em>, we need to perceive the crisis also as an opportunity to improve local services and boost local development in long term”</em>, said the President of NALAS, <strong>Mayor Emanuil Manolov</strong> in his opening speech.</p>\r\n<p title=\"OMC2\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//OMC2.png\" alt=\"OMC2\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><em>“Efforts must now focus on the recovery of our communities and economies. At the same time recovery should not be an aim in itself, but also provide for sustainable development and active policies. Now, more than ever we need real vertical and horizontal cooperation, coordination and consultation between levels of government, to prevent overlapping activities and to minimise the risk of fragmented responses. </em></p>\r\n<p><em>Local Government Associations play a key role in the coordination and cooperation across levels of government and therefore have an irreplaceable position in the response to the pandemic and in planning and implementing the social and economic recovery. They must be supported in these challenging tasks. </em></p>\r\n<p><em>As we will see today, lessons learned and shared experience can help SEE local governments in coping with future crisis. It is our responsibility as a regional network to document this knowledge and create opportunities for effective exchange. Similarly, we need to develop also policy recommendations and support advocacy efforts of our national local government associations”</em>, concluded Mr. Manolov.</p>\r\n<p>In her key address <strong>Ms. Gunn Marit Helgesen, </strong>President of the Chamber of Regions of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe focused on safeguarding local self-government in times of crisis, pointing out: <em>“Unfortunately, during the crisis we have witnessed very strong recentralisation trends towards the national executive, reduction in local decision making and budgetary autonomy, imposition of measures – even push for territorial reforms – without proper consultations with local authorities, postponement of local and regional elections, and difficulties of elected councils to fulfil their duties. The crisis has had a serious impact on the functioning of democratic institutions and on local self-government in particular, prompting the Council of Europe Secretary General to issue guidance to national governments.

Representatives of municipalities and cities around the Region presented their experiences with using the tools developed by the program, such as Municipal Finance Self-Assessment, Urban Audit and Citizens’ Score Cards. The event highlighted the good cooperation with NALAS and the helping hand it gives to contribute to the sustainability of UPP’s results.</p>\r\n<p title=\"21ga2\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga2.png\" alt=\"21ga2\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><em>“NALAS is a very unique organisation, with very big legitimacy and relevance”</em>, said Ms. Catherine Farvacque-Vitkovic from UPP. <em>“I see three main roles for NALAS in the future: 1. Serving as a repository of knowledge, 2. Acting as an accelerator for innovation, and 3. Catalyst for training of local staff and issues”</em>.     </p>\r\n<p>Mr. Elton Stafa, NALAS Project Manager, presented NALAS Regional Decentralisation Observatory, available at <a href=\"https://t.co/mKRlE8PfjH?amp=1\">https://nalas-observatory.eu</a>. <em>“This is a comprehensive data repository on local government issues in South-East Europe, aimed to support the creation of better policies and providing better local services to citizens</em>”, said Mr. Stafa.</p>\r\n<p>Ms. Božana Šljivar, from the City of Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Ms. Marina Jandrevska, from the Municipality of Kisela Voda, Skopje, North Macedonia, spoke about the importance of the Municipal Finance Self-Assessment tool in capital investment planning, emphasising that the tool enables municipal officers to project different scenarios, over different time horizons, as a basis for decision-making of the Mayor and the City Council.  </p>\r\n<p title=\"21ga3\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga3.png\" alt=\"21ga3\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Mr. Krste Micalevski, from the Municipality of Resen, North Macedonia, spoke about their experience with the Urban Audit, highlighting that finding the relevant statistical data was one of the key challenges. In the same time, the most important thing was citizens’ participation in the process.</p>\r\n<p title=\"21ga4\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga4.png\" alt=\"21ga4\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Mr. Dejan Vujić, from the City of Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina; and Ms. Merita Toska, from Co-Plan Institute for Habitat Development elaborated on using MFSA for COVID-19 impact assessment. They concluded that the tool is equally useful for ordinary and extraordinary events. It enables municipalities to analyse the impact of any event on municipal finances, making scenarios and simulations.</p>\r\n<p>During the session on Citizen Engagement, Mr. Sasho Trajkov, from Gazi Baba Municipality in Skopje, North Macedonia, Ms. Vesna Garvanlieva, from the Centre for Economic Analysis, North Macedonia and Ms. Sandra Kdolsky, from the World Bank, discussed the involvement of citizens in the development of their communities and the use of the so-called Citizens’ Score Cards.</p>\r\n<p title=\"21ga5\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga5.png\" alt=\"21ga5\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><em>“Obviously, citizens participation has to be adapted during the COVID-19 and similar crisis. That can be done by blending traditional engagement and digital solutions”</em>, said Ms.Kdolsky. </p>\r\n<p>In the closing session, representatives of Local Government Associations and local government experts shared the challenges and opportunities on local government finance in Western Balkans they expect in the upcoming year.</p>\r\n<p title=\"21ga6\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//21ga6.png\" alt=\"21ga6\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The main challenges are related to post COVID-19 social and economic recovery, which is coming with serious cuts of municipal budgets. The expected opportunities can come with improved relations between the central and local level, and a real decentralisation that will enable local governments to respond to citizens’ immediate needs and ensure community development. In addition, regional cooperation and learning from each other, as well as an inevitable digitalisation shall bring new opportunities. The role for Local Government Associations remains key in safeguarding local government finances and high quality of local services.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"UPP brought together city representatives from seven countries of the SEE region and beyond to exchange and to work together on the issues important to local governments all around the world. In 2011 the Program started modestly with only 10 cities while today we have over 120 cities and municipalities of all sizes joining the Program. It has been a great joy and pleasure to take this path together and have all of you and NALAS as our partners\"</em>, said Ms. Tamara Nikolic from UPP. <em>\"Our partnership with NALAS has been very important and NALAS has been a key partner in implementation of number of different initiatives so far, including e-learning academy, City to City dialogues, our flagship knowledge exchange events - Mayors Symposium, summer school on municipal finance and most recently on providing continuity and hosting the MFSA online tool.

In doing so, we have the power of our Networks – with a huge knowledge base, that enables us to identify needs and scale-up the know-how.”</em></p>\r\n<p>President Badan also spoke about the challenges that local governments in South-East Europe are facing when it comes to sustainability, resilience and inclusion, as well as NALAS’s and LGAs’ role in the related policy dialogue.</p>\r\n<p>She highlighted that at the present, local governments in South-East Europe face numerous challenges in executing their mandate, including three major ones: 1. Autonomy, 2. Social and economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis and 3. Inclusive local development.</p>\r\n<p><em>“Our efforts should be focused on economic and social recovery, but always through the perspective of decentralization of power and local development. For a successful recovery, SEE local governments expect changes in the legislation calling for increased financial decentralisation, stronger local tax powers, higher intergovernmental transfers and more flexible rules on local borrowing, as well as a higher level of engagement of the national government in enhancing digital infrastructure and digitalisation of local public services.”</em> – added the NALAS President.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, she added that building on the strong conviction that evidence-based policies can lead to better public policies and public services NALAS developed a Decentralization Observatory for South-East Europe. The Observatory helps inform the policy advocacy efforts of the LGAs, as stewards of local democracy and local governance in South-East Europe, but also support policymakers, experts, practitioners and researchers in their quest to improving local government policies and services.</p>\r\n<p><em>“Local Government Associations in our region and NALAS as their Network have on many occasions proven their irreplaceable position in advancing decentralisation and good local governance. They should be considered as key strategic partners in the recovery, reform and democratization processes. They indeed project an imperative importance of the bottom-up approach for national, international and global development.” – </em>concluded Mayor Tatiana Badan, NALAS President.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Watch the full address here:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vun5K8LgJ3s\" width=\"397\" height=\"223\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></strong></p>\r\n<p>The High Level Opening, also included the following prominent speakers:</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//closin21.jpeg\" alt=\"closing\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Thomas Gass, Ambassador, Assistant Director General, Head South Cooperation Department, SDC, Co-Chair Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation</li>\r\n<li>Ingolf Dietrich, Director, 2030 Agenda; poverty; democracy; rule of law; equality; human rights; education; Commissioner for sustainable development, BMZ</li>\r\n<li>Emilia Saíz, Secretary General, United Cities and Local Governments</li>\r\n<li>Hemanthi Goonasekera, Chief Executive Officer, Federation of Sri Lanka Local Government Authorities</li>\r\n<li>Stan Abma, Senior Coordinator, Capacity and Institution Building (CIB) Working Group, Project Manager, VNGi</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-tbdelog.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//tbdelog21.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//closin21.jpeg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-tbdelog.png", "path": "low-tbdelog.png", "checksum": "ba12b9ebbf756067bd8c832ac576d35a", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-tbdelog.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//tbdelog21.png", "path": "tbdelog21.png", "checksum": "b52399887aece3b3402478acf2460fbc", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//tbdelog21.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//closin21.jpeg", "path": "closin21.jpeg", "checksum": "0ac0631c729555a5556122ef4103d8b4", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//closin21.jpeg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

It provides regionally to exchange good practices and developing capacities of relevant state and non-state actors in the field of social and human rights and inclusion of vulnerable groups.  More specifically, it is integral part of the project “Regional Learning for the Implementation of the Agenda 2030 in South East Europe with focus on North Macedonia and Kosovo.” In this context, the forum intends to contribute towards enhancement of capacities of the SDGs coordination bodies at national level as well as empowering municipalities to initiate, lead and monitor the localization of SDGs in close coordination with civil society.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//social.jpg\" alt=\"sfff3\" width=\"209\" height=\"209\"></p>\r\n<p>The 2-day event with its panel discussions, working groups, plenary sessions and discussions focusing on LNOB social mapping, quality data for development policies and the Voluntary National Review process, allowed its participants to elaborate joint declarations containing a number of relevant recommendations on how to improve Kosovo’s roadmap towards the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs. These recommendations will be presented to the National Council of Sustainable Development within the Assembly of Kosovo and the office of the Prime Minister.</p>\r\n<p>NALAS, represented by Joachim Roth, stressed in its interventions the importance of partnership and dialogue as essential assets in a common effort to strengthen capacities, joint exchange, networking and learning for policy making that relies on evidence-based data and inter-institutional coordination to support the ambitious 2030 Agenda and its 17 SDGs in Kosovo.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//PristinaKs.jpg\" alt=\"socialdialogue\" width=\"218\" height=\"218\"></p>\r\n<p>There was a common understanding among participants that only a concerted, coordinated and streamlined effort of citizens together with its public administrations and authorities at central and local level can tackle successfully with the challenges and opportunities to leave no one and no space behind!</p>\r\n<p>*This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo Declaration of Independence.</p>\r\n<p title=\"socialdialogue\"> </p>\r\n            </div>", "image_urls": ["http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-sffff.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//sfsfsf.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//social.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//PristinaKs.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"], "file_urls": [], "files": [], "images": [{"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-sffff.jpg", "path": "low-sffff.jpg", "checksum": "b25a8ce42564dce7920433ee9d325755", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-sffff.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//sfsfsf.jpg", "path": "sfsfsf.jpg", "checksum": "7f957b769b6d03ecc37fbb1c75b71ffb", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//sfsfsf.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//social.jpg", "path": "social.jpg", "checksum": "afea354f7e2d70ce2dace318a094bff1", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//social.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//PristinaKs.jpg", "path": "PristinaKs.jpg", "checksum": "a1c38d92febd02fb65f86996c89f0ec0", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//PristinaKs.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png", "path": "low-diversity1.png", "checksum": "6894e371972fe06971b9c6e418663f16", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-diversity1.png"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg", "path": "low-SVDU1.jpg", "checksum": "99a8683a439365fbb4e3a4d4a54b2e69", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-SVDU1.jpg"}, {"url": "http://www.nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg", "path": "low-weber1.jpg", "checksum": "0bd3fb49840c29140d99c6bfb83697b9", "status": "downloaded", "relative": "/Files/Galleries//low-weber1.jpg"}]},,

Is Improved Governance Leading to Local Socio-Economic Development?    ", "article_index": 141, "published_on": "20.06.2019", "body": "<div class=\"description col-md-12\">\r\n                <p>The EU Enlargement Day organized by the European Committee of Regions, as its annual flagship event on EU enlargement policy, took place on 18-19 June, 2019 in Brussels, Belgium. NALAS has been participating in the Enlargement Day since 2016 and its continuous and active presence, both in the Joint Consultative Committee and Working Group meetings as well as in the plenary, demonstrates the close working relationship with the European Committee of the Regions' (CoR) and its CIVEX Commission (Commission for Citizenship, Governance, Institutional and External Affairs). </p>\r\n<p>The Enlargement Day 2019 took place for the 5<sup>th</sup> time focusing, since its initiation in 2015, on the growing realisation that a country joining the EU needs to prepare, not just its central government and administration, but also the local and regional level – as the level that eventually will implement more than 2/3 much of the EU legislation by adapting its principles and standards.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//P.ShilegovPanel.jpg\" alt=\"P.Shilegov\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Mr. Shilegov, in his function as Mayor of Skopje and President of NALAS and ZELS, initiated his key note address referring to the development process in Poland during and after the accession process. The Polish experience was characterized as a role model for the WB6 worth be emulated and learned from due to its motivating success to improve governance and boosting socio-economic development by actively involving the local government level. Interesting to note is that the contribution of local and regional authorities as government tiers was embedded at the same time in an ongoing decentralization process.</p>\r\n<p>The NALAS President stressed that the Forum of Cities and Regions in Rzeszow, a side event of Poznan 2019 under the Polish Presidency of the Berlin process, realised two weeks ago, impressively demonstrated the fact how EU funding support can improve governance leading to socio-economic transformation when local governments are actively involved in its implementation.</p>\r\n<p>In contrast, in the Western Balkans’, local governments face a disruption of the decentralisation process, are underfunded with limited fiscal autonomy and not effectively integrated as strategic partners in the EU accession process. In this context, it becomes evident that Western Balkans’ local governments are currently not in a position to play a transformative role as their Polish counterparts did.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//EnlargementDay.jpg\" alt=\"EUopening\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Mr. Shilegov then referred to the findings of two important recent regional NALAS surveys, the internal report of the Regional Decentralisation Observatory, and the 7<sup>th</sup> Fiscal Decentralisation Report for SEE, in order to provide evidence-based data. This data underlines the fact that even though there is a solid political, legal and administrative decentralisation process in place, there is a clear lack of adequate Fiscal &amp; Financial Autonomy. In other words, local governments in general have insufficient financial resources to effectively fulfil their obligations to provide quality public services to its citizen and to promote sustainable local socio-economic development. In general terms, EU funding has eased some of the pressure by providing soft infrastructure support, but has not yet been able to alleviate the capital investment constraints local governments face. These limitations are further broadened by an increased level of control and interference from higher levels of government in local priorities and affairs, especially via block grants.</p>\r\n<p>In such a context, the NALAS President emphasised that effective intergovernmental dialogue and continuous and ongoing cooperation with the respective national governments are a MUST to find solutions for improved governance.

Mr. Maksimovic said that representatives of vulnerable groups of Kraljevo have taken an active role in building a system for civil protection.  Due to frequent experiences with natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes, an awareness of the need for organization has been developed among residents of Kraljevo, hence a Network of Commissioners of Civil Protection has been established, shared Mr. Maksimovic. </p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//PolllDRM.png\" alt=\"Poll\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>As history has demonstrated in this series of webinars on social approaches moderated by Ms. Nikica Kusinikova, participants yet again proved their active engagement during the webinar, sharing not only their questions and ideas, but also their good practices.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/Files/Galleries//BoranDRM.png\" alt=\"Boran\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The concluding words were delivered by Mr. Boran Ivanoski, NALAS Programme Officer, who informed participants on the next steps and scaling up of the social approaches that were the thematic themes of the webinars as well as the e-learning courses that will become available on NALAS e-Academy.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong>Materials from the webinar</strong></p>\r\n<p title=\"AGENDA IDRM Webinar 18.03.2021 - final\"><a href=\"/Home/Download/agendaidrm\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> AGENDA IDRM Webinar 18.03.2021 - final</a></p>\r\n<p title=\"Inclusive DRM - Presentation Mr. Vasko Popovski\"><a href=\"/Home/Download/Vaskodrm\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> Inclusive DRM - Presentation Mr. Vasko Popovski</a></p>\r\n<p title=\"Presentation DRM - Tirana Ms Eleana Jupaj\"><a href=\"/Home/Download/Tiranadrm\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> Presentation DRM - Tirana Ms Eleana Jupaj</a></p>\r\n<p title=\"Presentation DRM - Kraljevo Mr Zdravko Maksimovic\"><a href=\"/Home/Download/Kraljevodrm\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> Presntation DRM - Kraljevo Mr Zdravko Maksimovic</a></p>\r\n<p title=\"WEBINAR flyer IDRM ENG FINAL\"><a href=\"/Home/Download/flyerDRM\"><img src=\"/Areas/Admin/Content/file-type/icons/pdf.png\" alt=\"\"> WEBINAR flyer IDRM ENG FINAL</a></p>\r\n<p title=\"WEBINAR flyer IDRM ENG FINAL\"> </p>\r\n<p><strong>Video recording</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ovFrg-HGDSQ\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></strong></p>\r\n<p><em>This webinar is activity of the NALAS project “Enhancing local capacities to implement the 2030 Agenda and the Leave No One Behind Principle”, implemented by the associations of local authorities from the Western Balkans in cooperation with and supported by the regional project on “Social Rights for Vulnerable Groups”.

", "article_index": 30, "published_on": "07.12.2021", "body": "<div class=\"description col-md-12\">\r\n                <p>The <strong>2021 European Union</strong> <strong>- Eastern Partnership Local Leaders’ Forum</strong> focused on <strong>“</strong><strong>Deliver more, serve better: Local Public Administration Reform as a booster for sustainable and inclusive development” </strong>was organised today by NALAS, in cooperation with PLATFORMA and the Council of European Municipalities and Regions (CEMR), the Latvian Association of Local and Regional Governments (LALRG) and the Association of Local Authorities in Lithuania (ALAL).</p>\r\n<p>Almost 100 participants and 15 speakers took part in the Forum, discussing the Local Public Administration Reform in the EaP and EU, the renew EU-EaP Agenda - how to make it more local oriented and the EU support to Local Public Administration Reform in Neighbourhood East. </p>\r\n<p title=\"eapf7\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//eapf7.png\" alt=\"eapf7\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>This was the third edition of the European Union - Eastern Partnership Local Leaders’ Forum, happening in a crucial moment for decentralisation and local public administration reforms. Decentralisation reforms have increased the role of local governments in key strategic sectors and while significant progress has been made, major challenges remain in terms of political commitment and advancing the fiscal dimension of trends.</p>\r\n<p><em>“We have been talking about decentralisation, local democracy and public administration reform for a long time. Probably more than you would like and more than just reasoning allows”</em>, said Mayor <strong>Tatiana Badan</strong>, NALAS President, in her opening speech. <em>“It cannot be said that there is no advancement on this subject, and in some countries even some successes. At the same time, if we talk in general, we notice slow tempo of these reforms. Moreover, lately, mainly due to the pandemic crisis, we have heard about certain attempts of re-centralisation, cuts in local finances, and in some countries even attempts to constrain local autonomy and democracy”</em>.</p>\r\n<p title=\"eapf2\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//eapf2.png\" alt=\"eapf2\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>Ms. Badan also appealed to the international community, to support local government autonomy and reforms as European values enshrined in the European Charter of Local Self-Government. At the same time, she called the donors to shape their assistance programmes based on the everyday, specific needs of local communities and their people, which are not always related to the global development trends.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mr. Frederic Vallier</strong>, CEMR Secretary General, emphasised that decentralisation and PAR are boosters for sustainable development. Since 2015, CEMR with the Committee of the Regions and the EU Commission initiated a programme for Eastern Partnership, helping local governments and their associations exchange and grow together.</p>\r\n<p title=\"eapf13\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//eapf13.png\" alt=\"eapf13\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>Ms. Mudite Priede</strong>, Secretary General of the Latvian Association of Local and Regional Governments highlighted the association is centring its activities around the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), in particular SD4-education and SDG13-climate action.</p>\r\n<p title=\"eapf3\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//eapf3.png\" alt=\"eapf3\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The first session of the Forum focused on the <strong>Local Public Administration Reform in the EaP and EU </strong>and included inputs by:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong> Viorel Furdui</strong>, Executive Director, Congress of Local Authorities of Moldova, Local Councillor</li>\r\n<li><strong> Yaroslav </strong><strong>Raboshuk</strong><strong>,</strong> Deputy Executive Director of AUC and Director of their Analytical Centre</li>\r\n<li><strong> Emil DRĂGHICI</strong>, Mayor of Vulcana-Băi, Romania, President of ACoR</li>\r\n<li><strong> David Melua</strong>, Executive Director, National Association of Local Authorities of Georgia</li>\r\n<li><strong> Silvia Georgieva, </strong>Executive Director National Association of Municipalities in the Republic of Bulgaria</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Mr. Viorel Furdui</strong> appealed to European institutions to hear the voice of local governments of the EaP region and not to confuse local public administration reform with territorial and administrative reform. Reforms cannot be replicated from elsewhere, but must be adjusted to given reality and existing current resources at hand to carry out reforms.</p>\r\n<p title=\"eapf4\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//eapf4.png\" alt=\"eapf4\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>Mr. Yaroslav Rabushuk</strong> emphasised that today local governments in Ukraine celebrate their national day and have a lot to celebrate. He referred to AUC’s experience of almost 35 years, in particular the operationalisation of MoUs with relevant ministries for improving local public services.</p>\r\n<p title=\"eapf5\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//eapf5.png\" alt=\"eapf5\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>Mr. Emil Draghici</strong> called the Committee of the Regions to establish a working group on Moldova - apart from CORLEAP.</p>\r\n<p title=\"eapf14\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//eapf14.png\" alt=\"eapf14\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The three speakers shared that rural pact for Romania; integration of the decentralisation reform in the constitution in Ukraine and a package of regulatory documents for institutionalising the dialogue with the central level in Moldova are some of the priorities for intergovernmental dialogue in these three countries.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mr. David Melua</strong> shared important lessons from Georgia, related to local government’s independence, but also local democracy, citizens’ participation in local decision making and leaving no one and no place behind.  </p>\r\n<p title=\"eapf15\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//eapf15.png\" alt=\"eapf15\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>Ms. Silvia Georgieva</strong> explained the complex political situation in Bulgaria, which currently does not have a government, but emphasised that as always, the local level is that one that operates and achieves results. Still, Bulgarian municipalities face major challenges in their financial independence, related specifically to three issues: 1) financial dependence from central transfers (70%), 2) small proportion of municipal resources from local taxes and fees, and 3) local financial system not viable.    </p>\r\n<p title=\"eapf8\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//eapf8.png\" alt=\"eapf8\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p>The strategic plan for the local level for 2030 developed by NAMRB has three main directions: 1) Everything is local-no one and no place is left behind,</p>\r\n<p>2) Everything is green-climate change adaptation and transition to greener society;</p>\r\n<p>3) Everything is digital-innovation and digitalisation.</p>\r\n<p>The second session of the Forum focused on <strong>the renew EU-EaP Agenda - how to make it more local oriented </strong>and<strong> the EU support to Local Public Administration Reform in Neighbourhood East </strong>and included inputs by:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong> Michael A. Rupp, </strong>Team leader DG NEAR - Eastern Partnership</li>\r\n<li><strong> Kata Tüttő</strong>, Deputy Mayor of Budapest and CORLEAP member</li>\r\n<li><strong> Tomasz Ostropolski</strong>, Decentralisation, Public Administration Reform at the Delegation of the European Union to Ukraine - Support Group for Ukraine</li>\r\n<li><strong> Vaida Aleknavičienė, </strong>Deputy Mayor of Joniškis (Lithuania) and PLATFORMA spokesperson</li>\r\n<li><strong> Viacheslav Nehoda</strong>, Deputy Minister for Communities and Territories Development of Ukraine</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Dr. Michael A. Rupp </strong>stated that economic growth, creating jobs and interconnection between EU and EaP are some of the priorities of the EaP-EU renewed agenda. Mayors for Economic Growth is the core of this approach, helping local governments design and implement Local Economic Development Plans.  </p>\r\n<p title=\"eapf9\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//eapf9.png\" alt=\"eapf9\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>Ms. Kata Tüttő </strong>said that trust is being created at local level bringing in citizens to participate and to cooperate and be part of the decision-making process. The pandemic showed rising trust for mayors and local level since they were frontrunners and the one who confronted the challenge even before the central level acted. Ms. Tüttő pointed out that to be able to implement the ambitious EU agenda related to green transition and green growth, local governments need to have the financial autonomy.</p>\r\n<p title=\"eapf16\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//eapf16.png\" alt=\"eapf16\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>Dr. Tomasz Ostropolski</strong> emphasised EU’s support to the decentralisation process in Ukraine, through the Unite with Europe programme, that committed 150 million EUR for these purposes.</p>\r\n<p title=\"eapf17\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//eapf17.png\" alt=\"eapf17\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>Ms. Vaida Aleknavičienė </strong>stated that it is important for local government to take the lead on reforms, as it is at the local level that citizens can see the benefits of reforms. Ms. Aleknavičienė also mentioned decentralised cooperation as an effective tool to reinforce local democracy in EaP countries.</p>\r\n<p title=\"eapf18\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//eapf18.png\" alt=\"eapf18\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>Mr. Viacheslav Nehoda</strong> presented some of the key results of the local public administration reform in Ukraine, related to territorial reform, sectoral decentralisation and financial decentralization.</p>\r\n<p title=\"eapf10\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//eapf10.png\" alt=\"eapf10\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>Ms. Marlene Simeon</strong>, CEMR Director of Operations and <strong>Mr. Kelmend Zajazi</strong>, NALAS Executive Director closed the 2021 EU-EaP Local Leaders Forum, summarising the key conclusions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ms. Simeon</strong> stated that autonomous local government, based on the European Charter is a fundament. PLATFORMA will continue to support EaP local governments through peer exchanges, trainings and much more. <em>\"We believe that the EU is now better placed to engage with EaP states in a more effective manner and to implement the post-2020 partnership policy agenda at all levels\"</em>, said Ms. Simeon, emphasising that EU institutions must see local governments as a key partner in local public administration reform. <em> </em><em>\"</em><em>There is now a need to localise the reforms, to increase the involvement of local elected representatives in reform agendas and consider them as significant policy-makers\".</em></p>\r\n<p title=\"eapf11\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//eapf11.png\" alt=\"eapf11\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>Mr. Zajazi</strong> summarised the key challenges for the future. <em>“Fiscal autonomy remains a key challenge in the EaP countries, but also throughout South-East Europe and beyond. Decentralisation is a complex reform that is unfortunately over time often overshade by other national reforms and agenda”</em>, said Mr. Zajazi. <em>“To overcome this, the process of decentralisation has to be aligned with other reforms, at national level, but also with the international donors and their programmes. The intergovernmental dialogue needs to be strengthened and institutionalised”</em>, concluded. Mr. Zajazi.</p>\r\n<p title=\"eapf12\"><img src=\"http://nalas.eu/Files/Galleries//eapf12.png\" alt=\"eapf12\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p title=\"eapf12\"> </p>\r\n<p title=\"eapf12\"><strong>Forum

Over 450 Mayors, Deputy Mayors, Presidents of City Councils and Local Government Association Managers took part in the Conference, confirming that local governments could provide a significant contribution in the EU integration process.  <br><br>The Conference showed that only progress towards the goal of enhanced integration with and within the EU, together with regional cooperation, can enable South-East Europe to develop and solve economic and social problems the region is facing. In that sense, Croatia’s membership in the EU is an important achievement and gives particular insight to other candidates and potential candidates as well as lessons to be learnt.</p>\r\n<p title=\"nexpo web 1\"><img src=\"http://nalas.sitecloud.cytanium.com/Files/Galleries//nexpo-web-1.jpg\" alt=\"nexpo web 1\" width=\"400\"></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In his welcoming speech, Mr. Vojko Obersnel, the Mayor of Rijeka said: \"Rijeka is often called Europe in small, due to its cultural diversity.

Croatia, as the newest EU member has rich experiences that will be shared during this Conference and the three days of NEXPO 2013. But, we also want to hear about your experiences and learn from you. We have tried to be good hosts and to give you the possibility to feel our city and the Region\".  <br><br>From the perspective of the European Union, the Vice-President of the European Parliament, Mr. Oldřich Vlasák, stated “I would like to share with you two thoughts. EU reality is quite complex. Being in Europe is not only receiving European funds, but also obeying to EU regulations, which impact our lives. By my Czech experience, local governments are the most affected by the EU regulations. Therefore, they must to be actively involved in creating policies on national and EU level. The second thought I would like to share, is about the common responsibility for a better world. We all have to engage for better European Union\".   <br><br>Mr. Gerhard Schumann-Hitzler, Director, IPA Strategy, European Commission, emphasized “All your countries that tend to join the European Union have to develop strategies for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, in line with the EU2020 Strategy.

It was dedicated to the challenges and potentials of SEE local governments. The President of NALAS, Mr. Anton Peršak stressed \"Although after the economic crisis EU is undergoing difficult times, both from economic and social perspective, it remains an important, unavoidable goal for the region.

Its overall objective aims to improve the conditions for the implementation of Agenda 2030 and reporting to the Western Balkans through regional exchange, networking and learning.</p>\r\n<p>The exchange with the chair of the Council of Sustainable Development of Kosovo corresponds to one of the projects’ outputs dedicated to support the SDGs coordination bodies in North Macedonia and Kosovo in their efforts to prepare Voluntary National Reports (VNRs) by providing analytical reports summarising results from the Thematic Groups ‘’Localization of SDGs’’ in both beneficiary countries.</p>\r\n<p>In this context, this first contact meeting focused on potential support measures the project can provide for the Council of Sustainable Development in its re-starting phase.
